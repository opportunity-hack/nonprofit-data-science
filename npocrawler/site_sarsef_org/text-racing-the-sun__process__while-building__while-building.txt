Design Review
Students submit plans throughout the design and building process for feedback and support from mentor judges. The plans are scored and factor in to the overall competition.
Based on the guidance of mentors, students continue to apply the engineering process by performing iterations, building on and improving their design each time.








Career Day
Students visit companies and universities as part of a field trip designed to inspire them to understand and pursue STEM careers and education. They tour multiple facilities engaged in solar energy, engineering, transportation, and manufacturing.
