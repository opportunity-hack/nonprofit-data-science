Approval before experiment
Science and engineering projects that involve human, animals, or hazardous substances may need scientific review committee (SRC) approval before they start experimentation in order to qualify for a fair. 
Learn more






Informed consent
Projects with human subjects — regardless of grade level and relationship to the subjects — must be reviewed by an institutional review board (IRB). Approval and consent from the human subject must be obtained, where necessary, before a student starts any experimentation.

Display and safety rules
Project presentations must adhere to display and safety rules. These rules ensure fair judging and a quality science and engineering fair for the community.
