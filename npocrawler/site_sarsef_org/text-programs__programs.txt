SARSEF programs teach critical thinking

With SARSEF, children don’t have to wait to become scientists or engineers. With curiosity as their guide, they can start asking questions they care about and use science and engineering to find solutions that are meaningful to them, and even, the world.
Every program uniquely prepares students for the future by giving them the tools and support they need to think like scientists and engineers, opening up career opportunities and helping them become informed citizens.
