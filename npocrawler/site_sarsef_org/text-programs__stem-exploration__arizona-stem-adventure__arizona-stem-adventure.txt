Arizona STEM Adventure
Every fall, 1,000 fourth through eighth-grade students from across Arizona adventure through a one-day glimpse into the world of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). Over 80 STEM professionals from throughout the community share their world to motivate students to complete a science or engineering project of their own.
Professional Development provides 50 teachers with best practices in guiding their students through the process of answering questions through science and engineering and $100 in materials.
Contact Danniey Wright at danniey@sarsef.org for more information.
