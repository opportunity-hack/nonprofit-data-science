Project Judging
Throughout the week, projects will be evaluated by judging teams and award recipients will be determined. According to the judging schedule for the week, students will have the opportunity to be interviewed over Zoom.
For grades PreK-8, interviews with judges are optional, but highly encouraged for grades 6-8.
For grades 9 through 12, interviews are required. Please excuse them from class to participate in these interviews.
