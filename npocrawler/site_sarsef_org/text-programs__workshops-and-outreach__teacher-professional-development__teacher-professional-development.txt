Teacher Professional Development
Offer your teachers confidence in teaching standard-based science and engineering processes and practices!
Using phenomena-based learning, SARSEF outreach professionals guide teachers on how to engage their students in creating quality science and engineering research projects by identifying meaningful and relevant real-life challenges. Teachers will explore thought-provoking hands-on activities, lesson design, and resources to make science and engineering experiences accessible to all students.
SARSEF will design Professional Development to meet your needs.
Available for Professional Development, Faculty Meetings, Teacher Consultations, and more. Contact America Miranda at america@sarsef.org to get started.
