ACES Camp
Applied Career Exploration in STEM (ACES) Camp for Girls is a week-long summer camp for middle school girls from Sunnyside Unified School District held every July. The camp is designed to explore a wide variety of careers, provide a path to potential success, and spark their interest in high education in the STEM fields. ACES stresses teamwork, use of technology, and hands-on learning, while giving students a feel for the college experience at a critical time in their lives.
After running for over a decade, the program has had more than 500 participants. Some camp alumni are now engineers, scientists, and interns. ACES focuses on the importance of math, science, and careers in technical sciences and underscores that women are essential in every career.
