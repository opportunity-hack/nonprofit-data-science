Racing the Sun
Racing the Sun (RTS) is an exciting engineering program that challenges high school students to design, build, and race solar-powered go-karts. It is open to all Arizona high schools.
Working with teachers and mentors, students spend nine months preparing for Race Day. Along the way, they apply physics, engineering, and energy. They solve real-world problems, using mathematical, analytical, and critical thinking skills. Students work in teams and collaborate on ideas. They are challenged to translate their ideas into a working prototype, and along the way, they build leadership skills.
Email our RTS Program Lead at RTS@sarsef.org for more information.

Race Day
Racing the Sun culminates in a Race Day at Musselman Honda Circuit, where high school teams from across Arizona race the solar-powered go-karts they engineered and built.
