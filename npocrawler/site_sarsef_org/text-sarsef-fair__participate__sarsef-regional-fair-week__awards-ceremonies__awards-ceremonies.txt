Winning at the SARSEF Fair
Award Recipient List
On Friday morning of the Fair, a list of award recipients is posted on the Fair Website. Students will need to attend the specified ceremony to discover what award(s) they’ve received.
Every school that participates with SARSEF will be celebrated in an edition of the Arizona Daily Star during fair week. Pick up a copy and see your school’s name!
Awards Ceremonies
Separate awards ceremonies are held for Elementary Grand Awards, Middle and High School Grand Awards, and Sponsored Awards. These three ceremonies are held in-person when feasible and will be live-streamed in the case that a virtual event is warranted.
Depending on the ceremony venue, students will collect their prizes and awards at the awards ceremony, from the SARSEF office, or from their school once delivered.
