Free educational outreach
Does your school need help getting started? Do you want to take your students’ research to the next level?
SARSEF can help.
SARSEF Education Specialists will come to your school to teach your students how to solve a real-world problem using science and engineering practices and get them excited about doing a research project.
By the time they leave, you won’t have to do any convincing! Together, we can make science and engineering fun for YOU and your students.
You will see how teaching students to do high quality science and engineering research will not only fulfill standards, but provide the content you need for your science curriculum this year.
