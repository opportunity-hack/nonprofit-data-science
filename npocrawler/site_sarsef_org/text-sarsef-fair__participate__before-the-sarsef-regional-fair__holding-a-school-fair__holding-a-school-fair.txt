Holding a school fair
If the number of projects completed at your school is greater than your allotment for projects that can advance to the SARSEF Regional Fair, you will need to hold a school science fair. We recommend that a teacher organizes this effort, however, some schools ask a key parent to do so.
The individual designated to lead the effort will be the Fair Director. They will organize and announce a time when all students who have completed a project will bring it to a centrally located place at the school for others to view. The school will then decide which projects will continue on to represent that school at SARSEF.
