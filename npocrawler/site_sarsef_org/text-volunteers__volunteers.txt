Inspiring future problem solvers

Every SARSEF program uniquely prepares students for the future by giving them the tools and support they need to think like scientists and engineers, opening up career opportunities and helping them become informed citizens. With curiosity as their guide, they can start asking questions they care about and use science and engineering to find solutions that are meaningful to them, and even, the world.
The success of these programs is only possible through the support of our community volunteers. Opportunities include a variety roles, both with and without a STEM background requirement. See where your interests lie and your talents fit best.
