Getting started



Levels of involvement
School and student involvement can range from becoming a full-scale science research school where everyone completes projects to partial school participation to independent entries.
Learn more





Free educational outreach
SARSEF Education Specialists will come to your school to teach your students how to solve a real-world problem using science and engineering practices and get them excited about doing a research project.
Learn more





Types of projects
Projects can be done by individual students, in small teams, or as a class/group. Students will determine their topic category and whether their project is science or engineering.

Before the SARSEF Regional Fair



Holding a school fair
If the number of projects completed at your school is greater than your allotment for projects that can advance to the SARSEF Regional Fair, you will need to hold a school science fair. 
Learn more





Selecting projects for the SARSEF Fair
Each school should hold its own science fair and choose top projects to advance to the SARSEF Regional Fair, based on the school's allocation. 
Learn more





Registering projects for the SARSEF Fair
In January, registration for the SARSEF Regional Fair opens. School Fair Directors can register winning projects and upload files.

On Friday morning of the Fair, a list of award recipients is posted on the Fair Website. Students and families attend the Awards Ceremonies on Saturday of Fair Week to discover what award(s) they've received.

Other competitions
SARSEF winners may qualify for other competitions, and often, projects for SARSEF may be used in additional competitions.
