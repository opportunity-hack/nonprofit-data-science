Exhibitors
Do you work with an organization that loves sharing about science or engineering? Consider being an exhibitor or partner at one of our events. Collaborations and partnerships help us to bring a wider variety of hands-on science to teachers, students, and community members.   
If you have an idea of an activity you or your organization can present at an event to showcase your profession and contributions to the world of STEM, let’s work together!
Email Danniey Wright at danniey@sarsef.org for more information about how to become involved in our next event.
