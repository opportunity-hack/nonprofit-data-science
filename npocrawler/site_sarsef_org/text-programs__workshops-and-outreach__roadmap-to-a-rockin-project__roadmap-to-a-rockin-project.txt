Roadmap to a Rockin’ Project
Parents/caregivers and students work together to identify an issue they care about and are guided in the development of a science or engineering research project. Students leave ready to investigate their topic with a roadmap for their research journey and their very own lab notebook. Parents/caregivers take away a better understanding of their supporting role in the process of student research.
Stay tuned for the dates of our upcoming Roadmap Workshops!
