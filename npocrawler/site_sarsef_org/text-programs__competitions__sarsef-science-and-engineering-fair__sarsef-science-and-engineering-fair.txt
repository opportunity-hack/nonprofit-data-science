SARSEF Regional Science and Engineering Fair
Every year, PreK-12 students from across Southern Arizona participate in a SARSEF-affiliated fair, conducting research projects to be considered as a representative of their school. Students with the top projects advance to a week-long competition and celebration of their achievements.
Around 2,000 projects typically compete at the SARSEF Regional Fair, and over $100,000 in prizes, trips and scholarships are awarded, thanks to our community support. Top high school students move on to international levels of competition.
