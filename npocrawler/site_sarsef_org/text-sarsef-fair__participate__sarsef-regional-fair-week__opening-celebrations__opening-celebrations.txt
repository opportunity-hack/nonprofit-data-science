Opening Celebrations
To kick off the SARSEF Regional Fair and the opening of the virtual project floor, we will have a large Opening Celebration to congratulate all those who have participated in science and engineering projects this year. In this way, all students who have completed research are winners and the Opening Celebration is where we, as a community, can encourage the future innovators of Southern Arizona.
Held in-person when possible, this event is for the whole family. Attendees can view projects, participate in hands-on science with exhibitors, and explore the latest innovations with professional scientists and engineers.
If in-person events are not feasible, this event will be held virtually.
