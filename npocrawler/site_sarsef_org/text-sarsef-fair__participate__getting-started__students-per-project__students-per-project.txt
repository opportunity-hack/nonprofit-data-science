Determine team size
Projects can be done by individual students, in teams, or as a class/group.
Individual (1 student)
Each student works on his or her own idea, and does their own research and project board.
Team (2-3 student)
Teams of two or three students decide on the same topic, and work together to research and present. (Each student needs to be involved in all phases – they should not divide and conquer.)
Group or Class Project (4+ student)
Four or more students, or an entire class, agree on one topic and work on it together. Each member of the group or class should be a part of the entire process, and keep their own lab book/journal with notes about the process and data.
Note: Group/class projects will be judged separately from individual and team projects at the SARSEF Fair. Middle and High School Group/class projects will not be eligible for Broadcom MASTERS, the International Science and Engineering Fair, and scholarships.
Science or engineering
Students will need to determine whether they are creating a science research project or engineering research project. Although very similar, scoring and judging is slightly different. As a basic rule, science is answering questions, while engineering is solving problems. 
Project categories
Projects are judged according to the category they are assigned. Some projects may fit into multiple categories. When registering, students will determine which category they feel their project fits best. If students are having trouble selecting a category, it might help for them to consider what background they want the judges reviewing their project to have.
