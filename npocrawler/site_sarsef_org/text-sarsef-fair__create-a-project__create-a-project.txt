Create a project

The science and engineering practices are part of the framework from the National Research Council (NRC) of the National Academy of Sciences and are meant to help guide teachers, parents, and students through a science and engineering project. It is important to note that these practices are part of a dynamic process, and students may revisit each one more than once as they investigate their topic.
