 September 21, 2020JobPath Names Ana Greif as Chief Executive OfficerTucson, AZ, Release: September 21, 2020. For Immediate Release
JobPath announced today that after an extensive national search, the Board of Directors has selected Ana Greif to be JobPath’s new Chief Executive Officer.
Throughout the interview process, Ana displayed her passion for helping students overcome the disparities and deficiencies in the education system and enable students to use education to rise out of poverty. She demonstrated considerable knowledge as to the issues that impact students’ ability to achieve success.
Previously, Ana worked at Pima Community College where her work focused on building relationship with employers and creating opportunities for students. She will leverage this experience to help grow JobPath’s programs in the future. Ana has demonstrated her ability to reach new students in her expansion of the PCC Tuition Reimbursement program. Her ability to grow that program by 400% shows that she has the skills, knowledge, and initiative to grow JobPath.
Ana has a Bachelor’s Degree in Business Administration from the University of Arizona, a Master’s of Science in Public Policy and Management from Carnegie Mellon University, and is currently a doctoral student at Johns Hopkins University where her research focuses on the training needs of post-traditional students.
“JobPath is in a period of transition. The Board, Ana, and the entire JobPath staff look forward to increasing community engagement to understand the needs of employers in the post-COVID environment. We will be working to identify new programs of study and work to expand the number of students we serve. Each of us are dedicated to this community and our students. We are confident that with Ana at the helm, JobPath will be ready to move into the next phase. Please help us in welcoming Ana Greif to JobPath.” Said Catherine Merrill, President of Job Path’s Board of Directors.
