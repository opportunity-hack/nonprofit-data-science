Our Mission
The Center for Economic Integrity builds economically strong communities for all and opposes unfair corporate and government practices.
Our Challenge
The extreme economic divide in our country, and the public policy that encourages it, will not change unless and until we challenge head on the powerful industries that profit excessively on the backs of workers, consumers, children and families.
Our Promise
Creates change from the ground up – must be defined by people directly impacted and outcomes must be achieved through diverse community coalitions that share a stake in success – believe our partnership approach and proven strategies lead to sustainable economic change for the better.
