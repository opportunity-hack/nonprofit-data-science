Research Reports
The Center employs two primary research methods Strategic Corporate Research and Participatory Research. Through Corporate Research the Center illuminates the practices and impacts of specific companies on industries in communities of concern. Our second research method involves Participatory Research. With this approach, the Center can more directly involve and compensate impacted constituencies in its fact-finding.
