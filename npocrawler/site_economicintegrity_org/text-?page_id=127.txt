Economic Development


Corporations and industries such as Auto Title lenders strip wealth not only from working families but from local economies. These economic exporters extract millions of dollars from states such as Arizona and New Mexico each year. In Arizona, which is similar to Virginia, title lenders take in an estimated $316.5 million in revenue per year. This money is stripped from working families and no longer available to circulate in local economies.
