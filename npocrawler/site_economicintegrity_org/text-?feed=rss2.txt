Did you know that in September, Arizona celebrates Kinship Family Month? May I tell you about these families, how they serve the community, and how they can be strengthened? I’m a member of Arizona Grandparent Ambassadors (AZGA), advocates for increased recognition and support for kinship families.
In a kinship family, grandparents, other extended family members or close family friends are raising children without parents in the home. Census data indicate that over 55,000 children in Arizona live in these families. Kinship families may be created voluntarily or after intervention by child protection authorities for reasons including death of parents, military deployment, incarceration or abuse.

 Daily Independent | By Brent Ruffner | April 9, 2021
 
Some local advocacy groups are calling for support of proposed laws that would help to bar some fringe lenders from imposing hefty interest rates on short-term loans.
Officials from the Phoenix-based group Wildfire and the Center for Economic Integrity say proposed national legislation could halt triple-digit interest rates that get passed onto consumers on short-term loans such as advances given in exchange for a car titles.
New laws could block companies similar to title loan firms from charging more than state interest rate caps allow. Lawmakers could use the Congressional Review Act to reverse current rules regarding high short-term loan interest rates.
In the past, companies typically have evaded rate caps by putting out-of-state banks on the loan paperwork, opponents of fringe lenders claim.
Last month, U.S. Sens. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, and Congressman Chuy García, D-Illinois, introduced the resolution.
“Arizona law caps the annual interest rate on a $2,000, 2-year loan at 41%,” said Wildfire Executive Director Cynthia Zwick. “But several high-cost online installment lenders are offering loans in Arizona at rates up to 160% or higher by putting an obscure bank’s name on the loan agreement.“There is no other way to define or describe that than as a pure, appalling example of predatory lending,” Ms. Zwick said.
Arizona has a cap on some high-interest loans in part after voters rejected in 2008 an measure that would have allowed payday lenders to continue operating in the state beyond 2010.
Ms. Zwick said high rates make it tough for low-income families to pay back short-term loans. She said many of the lower income families may not have access to credit, and aggressive marketing tactics make the short-term loans enticing.
High-interest lending in a variety of arenas is a regular fixture for Arizona borrowers, but not all have operated legitimately.
In 2020, the Arizona Attorney General announced a settlement with Texas-based Santander Consumer USA Inc., one of the nation’s largest subprime auto lenders. The settlement gave more than 12,000 Arizona car buyers millions of dollars in financial relief following allegations that Santander violated consumer protection laws by giving high-interest loans to car buyers it knew could not afford them.
The announcement said Arizona consumers would receive between $22.7 million and $41.5 million of relief through restitution checks, in-kind relief, or debt forgiveness.
Kelly Griffith, executive director of the Center for Economic Integrity in Tucson, said her nonprofit group helps consumers on various issues. She said the group believes Arizona’s consumer lending laws need to change.
“It basically says this is wrong,” Ms. Griffith said. “You are undercutting the states.”
Advocates of the current laws say short-term borrowing methods have been essential, especially since the start of the pandemic.
According to published reports, Checkmate CEO Jennifer Robertson said short-term loans are handy for those who might not have a bank account. She said one in four Arizona residents don’t “hold depository accounts at traditional financial institutions,” according to a 2017 FDIC annual report.
In published reports, Ms. Robertson said check cashing is essential to communities during rough economic times.
“We deliver liquidity into our communities through a variety of services, including check cashing, wire services and provisioning small loans, all regulated according to federal laws and state-specific statutes that in many cases, cap our fees,” Ms. Robertson said in the report.
James McGuffin, spokesman for the Arizona Department of Insurance and Financial Institutions, said officials cannot comment on any proposed legislation.
The Arizona Department of Insurance and Financial Institutions enforces financial institution and insurance laws to help protect consumers against any type of fraud.
“We don’t want to get into the middle of that,” Mr. McGuffin said. “We are here to enforce whatever the state legislature puts on the books.”
Ms. Griffith said legislators need to take action in order to protect consumers.
“It’s necessary if we are going to protect the lending laws in this state.”

Congress to Introduce Resolution Rescinding “Fake Lender” Rule Enabling Predatory Lenders to Evade Arizona’s Interest Rate Limits

330+ groups from 50 states, District of Columbia support overturning rule that helps triple-digit interest rate loans bypass state and voter-approved interest rate caps
 News Release: March 29, 2021








CONTACTSKelly Griffith, Executive Director, Center for Economic Integrity, kelly@economicintegrity.org, (520) 250-4416Cynthia Zwick, Executive Director, Wildfire, (602) 604-0640; czwick@wildfireaz.org
PHOENIX, AZ – Wildfire and the Center for Economic Integrity applaud plans by Senators Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Sherrod Brown (D-OH) and Congressman Chuy García (IL-4) to introduce Congressional Review Act (CEA) resolutions eliminating a Trump-era regulation that helps lenders charging 179% APR or more evade state- and voter-approved interest rate caps.
Issued by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the rushed “fake lender” rule took effect in December. It protected “rent-a-bank” schemes enabling predatory lenders (the true lender) to launder their loans through a few rogue banks (the fake lender), which are exempt from state interest rate caps. The rule overrides 200 years of case law allowing courts to see through usury law evasions, replacing it with a pro-evasion rule that looks only at the fine print on the loan agreement.
Wildfire and the Center for Economic Integrity of Arizona have joined a broad coalition of 338 organizations from all 50 states and the District of Columbia calling on Congress to overturn the “fake lender” rule, which threatens to “unleash predatory lending in all 50 states.” According to national polling, two-thirds of voters (66%) are concerned about the ability of high-cost lenders to arrange loans through banks at rates higher than state laws allowed.
“Arizona voters were very clear in 2008 that triple digit interest rate loans should not be legal in our state, voting by a 60-40 percent margin to get rid of payday lenders. The fake lender rule allows these predators to once again inflict devastating financial harm on our most vulnerable community members,” says Kelly Griffith Executive Director Center for Economic Integrity.
Predatory lenders charging 100% to 200% APR are already starting to push high-cost installment loans in Arizona that exceed rates permitted under Arizona law. Others, including payday lenders, plan to expand to states that do not allow their high-cost loans.
“Arizona law caps the annual interest rate on a $2,000, 2-year loan at 41%. But several high-cost online installment lenders are offering loans in Arizona at rates up to 160% or higher by putting an obscure bank’s name on the loan agreement,” said Wildfire Executive Director Cynthia Zwick. “There is no other way to define or describe that than as a pure, appalling example of predatory lending.”

As was done more than a dozen times under President Trump, Congress could use the Congressional Review Act to rescind recently finalized regulations, including the OCC’s “fake lender” rule, with a majority vote in both chambers, limited debate, no filibuster and the president’s signature. The resolution rescinding the “fake lender” rule must be voted upon by a certain date, currently estimated between May 10 and May 21.
The coalition of signatories to the letter includes civil rights, community, consumer, faith, housing, labor, legal services, senior rights, small business, student lending, and veterans organizations. The full text of the letter can be found here.
A 2-page explanation of the “fake lender” rule is here, a brief explaining how these predatory lenders target veterans is here and a “watch list” of predatory lenders evading state interest rate limits is here.

The pandemic has heightened challenges for multigenerational caregivers, many of whom are vulnerable to the virus while taking care of children.One in four children living with grandparents are Black, according to Annie E. Casey Foundation KidsCount data using U.S. Census figures. The data was central to a report from Generations United, a nonprofit for multigenerational families.Black children are also disproportionately represented in foster care, and their kinship caretakers are essential, filling gaps in child welfare systems, the nonprofit says.

 News Release: November 9, 2020 | (En Español)

(Tucson, AZ – November 9, 2020) As part of the City of Tucson’s CARES Act funds, Mayor and Council approved $500,000 to be distributed to families in need of help covering child care expenses during the pandemic. Administered by Catholic Community Services of Southern Arizona, the funds will be distributed as scholarships to families and child care facilities granting up to $2,275 per child with no limit to the number of children in a family. 
“For many working families, having reliable and safe childcare, particularly during the pandemic, can be the difference between going back to work or staying home,” said Mayor Regina Romero. “The scholarships will help low-income families pay for safe child care, giving them peace of mind when they leave home to provide for their loved ones.” 
The child care scholarships will cover expenses for children 12 years and younger. Families must reside in the City of Tucson or City of South Tucson. Priority will be given to individuals and families who have not yet received any state or federal COVID-19 relief money and have experienced financial hardship impacting their ability to pay for child care.    
“We are grateful to Mayor Romero for her leadership and the Council for their support of this vital program,” said CEO Peg Harmon, Catholic Community Services. “Since the announcement of the program in September, 60 childcare providers and 95 families have sent inquiries about the fund. Tucson families need this help so parents can work and their children can be safe.” 
“We’re delighted that Mayor Romero and the Tucson City Council are leading the way to affordable early childhood education,” said Penelope Jacks, The Preschool Promise. “Early childhood education is vital for children’s success, families’ ability to work, and the City’s economic growth.” 
Families can receive assistance for children currently enrolled in child care and/or newly enrolling children. Child care expenses will be paid directly to the provider. Full eligibility requirements for families and child care facilities, along with the application, can be fund at ccs-soaz.org. The program runs through December 31, 2020 or until funds are expensed.

Economic inequities: The impact of systemic racism on your finances
People of color—particularly Black people—have been treated unfairly and unequally for generations in the area of personal finance and beyond. Centuries of racism have denied Blacks, Native Americans and many immigrants an equal opportunity to build a solid financial foundation. 
Analysts point to the systemic racism that is woven into many of our nation’s institutions as the legacy of our shameful early history of enslaving Africans.
Evidence of entrenched discrimination can be seen in this country’s economic, educational, law enforcement, prison and healthcare systems.
