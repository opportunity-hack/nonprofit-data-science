Relatives get $600 less than foster parents to care for a child. Should that change?Kinship Care 


 Mary Jo Pitzl, ARIZONA REPUBLIC | azcentral.com, Aug. 21, 2018

Story Highlights

A woman caring for her two nieces gets $90 from the state. A foster parent would get $1,300.
The disparity has been magnified by DCS’s emphasis on placing kids with kin.
A decade ago, 32 percent of children in state custody were with kin. Today, it’s 43 percent.
