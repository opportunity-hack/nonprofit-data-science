We Are All Consumers
Middle and low-income consumers must navigate myriad, potentially dangerous financial products and services designed to trap them in an unending cycle of debt. Corporations and industries are constantly evolving to circumvent common sense state and federal regulations enacted to prevent unfair, deceptive and unconscionable practices such as triple-digit small loans (payday loans, title loans).
Banks, mortgage lenders, insurance companies, cryptocurrency and the financial technology era all pose additional risks and challenges for unsophisticated or desperate consumers. As the economic divide continues to widen, so do the types of financial products and services targeted specifically to financially disadvantaged individuals and families.

Harmful debt collection practices
The CFPB issued two bulletins to both creditors and debt collectors reminding them they may not misrepresent the amount, character, or legal status of debts they are collecting, fail to post payments, falsely threaten arrest, or take other unfair, deceptive or abusive action.
In addition, another bulletin warned debt collectors they may not misrepresent the effect of payment on credit scores and creditworthiness. The CFPB also announced it will now accept consumer complaints on debt collection and published sample action letters consumers may send to collectors to dispute the debt, request proof of the debt, and restrict or stop communication.
