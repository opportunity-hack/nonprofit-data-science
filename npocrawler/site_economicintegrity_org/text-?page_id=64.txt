Our Successes
Grandparent and Kinship Families


Huge progress was made from 2017 to 2018 with regards to increasing the number of eligible families who applied for, and received the grandparent raising grandchildren stipend ($75.00 per month), by working with the Governor’s office and state agency administrators (Department of Children and Families – DCS). Expansion of eligibility and administrative outreach by DCS is a direct result of AZGA advocacy efforts and a significant public policy victory.



A direct result of discussions at the 2018 Grandparent’s Summit where the Assistant Director of the Office of Community Engagement (OCE at DES) spoke, was an internal review at DES which identified incorrect application of the policy for “TANF Child Only Kinship” resulting in a total of $19,928 issued in 2019 on 113 past cases that were reviewed and re-opened!



Payday Lending Reform
CEI won a first and only victory banning payday lenders in Arizona and now helps communities across the country combat similar 400% interest rates nonprofits in developing new products and services, like pre-paid debit cards, to take the place of payday loans.

Reform of Labor Brokers
CEI pushed through legislation holding for-profit day labor companies accountable in Arizona and New Mexico. CEI has helped three nonprofits in the Gulf Coast region launch nonprofit labor brokering enterprises to better meet the needs of workers and employers.
Money Back Into Laborers’ Pockets

For-profit day labor brokers charge workers for everything from work gloves and boots to cashing their paychecks. CEI documented those abuses and mobilized laborers, construction companies and high-road staffing companies to clean up the industry with legislation in AZ and NM.
Labor Ready was forced to refund over $150,000 in check cashing fees to its Arizona workers as a result of our work. Now the many fees that this corporation and other brokers used to take from workers stay in those workers’ pockets. That means literally millions of dollars back into the hands of hard-working laborers in the southwest region.
Nationwide, CEI has helped to develop nonprofit brokers based on Primavera Works in Tucson, AZ. This gives workers and employers an alternative to unfair labor brokers.

National Media Coverage
NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO, Marketplace Morning Report, July 1, 2010
“Hundreds of stores in Arizona will no longer be able to charge triple-digit interest rates. Consumer groups hail the new protections for Arizona borrowers… [The] Center for Economic Integrity has organized volunteers who will spy on lenders and report abuses to state officials.”
THE PROGRESSIVE MAGAZINE, January 2007
The writers and photographers of a tiny book titled People Around Us are Arizona and New Mexico low wage earners: Wal-Mart cashiers, day laborers, servers… Published by [the] Center for Economic Integrity, People Around Us was designed as a way to ‘amplify the voices of low wage earners in an undiluted, unmediated form.’
THE CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR, December 20, 2004
“In Arizona, new laws prohibit common practices used in other states, such as charging fees that reduce hourly pay rates to levels below the minimum wage. ‘It’s a matter of ensuring the homeless won’t be getting exploited for the sake of the company’s profits.’ according to [the] Center for Economic Integrity.”
MOTHER JONES MAGAZINE, March/April 2002 Issue
“‘If day labor were reframed to be transitional work, then it could be a valuable thing,’ says [the] Center for Economic Integrity. ‘Ultimately, it’s got to lead to something better.’”
NEWAMERICAMEDIA.ORG, April 7, 2001
“For years, advocates…have been pushing for federal action that would quash such predatory practices [as rapid tax refund anticipation loans]. Finally, momentum is on their side… [The Center for Economic Integrity]and other advocates urge families to get their taxes done free at Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) or AARP Tax-Aide sites… all money goes to the taxpayer.”
