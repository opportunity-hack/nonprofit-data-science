Testimonials
“In our 14-year history as a nontraditional nonprofit, fully volunteer run, we’d struggled with capacity issues and raising money to attain key goals.  Somehow within 3 hours of working with our facilitator, we had a clear understanding and consensus for our next steps. This could never have been achieved during our scheduled board meetings without her facilitation. I wish we’d thought of giving something like this to ourselves as board members long ago.”
Carole Sheehan, TPDC Founder, Outgoing President | March 2019
