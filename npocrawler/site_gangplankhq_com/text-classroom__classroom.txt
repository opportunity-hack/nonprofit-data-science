Classroom 

Our classroom space is available for reservations 
If your group or organization would like to host a class or meeting, please check that your preferred date and time is available on the calendar below first. 
Reservations are available during normal business hours. After hours reservations are available with keyholder assistance. 
Then, stop by for a tour of the space. 
During the tour, ask a keyholder about your after hours event, and if they’d be willing to let you in and lock up afterward.
Important note: We reserve the right to decline hosting events, for any reason. Don’t make it weird.
