1. My project is about how temperature affects magnets pull. 
2. I chose this project because magnets work effectively in room temperature, but if magnets are hot or cold would it make a difference?
3. My result was cold magnets work the best
4. My project is important because it shows how to maximize your use of magnets.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
