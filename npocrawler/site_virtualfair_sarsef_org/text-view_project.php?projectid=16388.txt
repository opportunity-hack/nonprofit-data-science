1.The purpose of my project is to figure out what type of sugar works best in my favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe. 
2. I chose this project because I like baking, and have always wondered if different types of sugars would affect the cookie’s taste or texture. 
3. The result of my experiment is brown sugar was liked best in the chocolate chip cookie recipe. 
4. My project is important because it helps me know what type of sugar to use when I make cookies.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
