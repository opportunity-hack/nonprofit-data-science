Everyone relies on WiFi today. We use it for online school, games, Facetime, google meets, youtube, and even TV! Learning about what materials slow down the WiFi is important because it will help you know where the WiFi router should be placed at your home. This science experiment finds an answer to what slows down the WiFi signal the most. WiFi routers were found to be less effective when surrounded by brick and plastic and performed the best with no interference around.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Good job being curious about a subject that posed a real problem for many as more people worked from home and relied more on WiFi speeds.
Nice! Good Job comparing both the networks! Nice work
