Construction of a Low-tech Hydroponic System & Its Effect on the Growth of Arugula (Eruca vesicaria sativa)

This project follows the construction of a low-tech and cost-effective hydroponic system. Hydroponics can be an expensive field, and this project attempts to create something that can be made on the individual level, which can allow one to grow their own food and participate less in commercial farming and its environmental consequences. Arugula (Eruca vesicaria sativa) was grown in the hydroponic system, and data was collected over a three-week period; this data showed that the plants experienced significant growth, which proved the hydroponic system was successful. This research is important in the face of climate change, which makes it harder to grow food, and in the face of a growing population, which makes it even more necessary.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
