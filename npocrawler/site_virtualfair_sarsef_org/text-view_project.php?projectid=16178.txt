HS-EL006
Using an LDR to Detect the Ripeness of a Red Delicious Apple
Electrical and Mechanical Engineering

Grade:
HS

Teacher:
Michael Frank, PhD

My project uses an electronic circuit with components like LDRs and LEDs to bounce light off of Red Delicious apples and determine their ripeness. I chose this project because I make things with electronics all the time and I was wondering if I could determine the ripeness of an apple with simple electronic components. My conclusions were that I could determine the ripeness of apples with a simple circuit, and so my hypothesis was supported. My project is important because perhaps the concept could be used in a larger machine to automatically pick fruits based on their ripeness, increasing the amount of ripe fruits picked while reducing human labor costs.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
