My project is about making paper from recycled materials.  I chose this project because I am interested in our environment and how to save the earth.  I was able to make 4 different kinds of recycled paper.  My project is important because we need to keep as many thing out of our landfill as possible.
This project has been cleared by SRC.


Comments

I like the observation that each trial you were better at making the paper. Is that a variable?
Very creative project!
This was a well thought out project and quite creative.  You did an excellent job!
