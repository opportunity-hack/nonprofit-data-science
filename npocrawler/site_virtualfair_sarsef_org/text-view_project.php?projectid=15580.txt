When I go up Mt Lemmon, I see how native plant life changes from desert and cactus at the base to different native plants along the way with evergreens at the top. I wondered how the soil changes where the plants and trees change the higher in elevation you go. To answer this, I tested soil at the base plus the nine locations where plant life changed. I tested soil temperature, light, moisture, pH, and nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, potash). Results showed the moisture level increased with elevation. I hope my project will encourage people to choose plants and trees that grow natively. In Tucson, this means plants that need less water.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Your question was very interesting, and you did a great job with your project!
Great project! I wonder how it might change along the same wash or underground river as the elevation changes. I love that you got me more curious about something I've never considered before!
This was a well designed project which began with excellent questions and observation.  Great work!
Your idea was a good way to explore the different soil conditions we are able to experience so close to Tucson.
Interesting question and testing procedure.  We hope you continue use your creative questions to study and experiment in our diverse and beautiful desert.
