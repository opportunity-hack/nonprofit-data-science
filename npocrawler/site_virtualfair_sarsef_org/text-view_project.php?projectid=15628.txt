1. My project looked at whether or not snails reproduce quicker if given more food. 
2. I chose this project because I noticed that my snails at home reproduce very quickly and i don't feed them a lot. I wanted to see if they would reproduce even quicker if I fed them more. 
3. My result was that Malaysian Trumpet Snails do not reproduce quicker if given more food.
4. My project is important because it helps humans control the role of reproduction for Malaysian Trumpet Snails
This project has been cleared by SRC.


Comments

Thank you for teaching me so much about Malaysian Trumpet snails. I liked how you made note that the murky water might have had an impact on the results. Good observation
