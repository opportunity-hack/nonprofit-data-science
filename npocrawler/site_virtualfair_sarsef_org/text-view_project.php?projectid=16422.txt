My project is about studying the data microfossils provide us on the indian monsoon and the atmosphere during the last glacial period to figure out how global warming affected this climatic event.
I chose this project because global warming is of immediate importance and danger to humankind and understanding its effects on Earth is crucial for others to realize the importance of the issue.
The overall conclusion of the study was that the Indian Monsoon increased in intensity with global warming from a glacial to interglacial state.  My project is important because it gives insight on the issue of global warming and provides specific examples of its repercussions in certain parts of our world, in this case, India.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
