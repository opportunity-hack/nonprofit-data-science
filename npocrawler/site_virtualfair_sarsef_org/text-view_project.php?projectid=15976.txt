Which Paper Towel Brand Absorbs Best?

Which paper towel brand absorbs best? This was the question I chose to experiment on for my science fair project. I chose this question because I wanted to test which paper towel brand performed best with absorption while still having a reasonable and affordable price. The three brands I chose for this experiment were Bounty paper towels, Brawny paper towels, and Great Value Ultra Strong paper towels. All rising from about $8.42 to $13.99. 
I started out by doing 4 trials of each paper towel brand. With trial one and two absorbing water, trial 3 absorbing milk, and trial 4 absorbing A & W root beer soda. I then tore one sheet of each paper towel brand to soak up each liquid. Then in addition to this, I would pour a quarter cup of liquid on a flat surface, such as a counter, and lay the sheet of paper towel over the liquid, and wait for it to absorb most, or if not all of the liquid. I would then squeeze all the liquid the paper towel collected into a measuring cup and write down how much liquid the certain paper towel brand soaked up. Surprisingly, Great Value Ultra Strong paper towels soaked up the most liquid within all 4 trials. Measuring up to 3 tablespoons in all 4 trials. In conclusion, within the three brands I experimented with, the option that costs the least amount of money absorbed the best in this case.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
