Animal and Plant Sciences

Anya Maurer
Grade:
3

Teacher:
Sheri McLain

The purpose of this experiment is to see if temperature affects how fast seeds sprout.? I became interested in this experiment when I learned that the Earth’s temperatures are changing.? The information gained through this experiment will gardeners and farmers know the best temperature to grow their seeds.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
