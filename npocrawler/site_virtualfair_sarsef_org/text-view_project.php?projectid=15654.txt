Does the Ketogenic Diet Affect Cognitive Ability in People With Parkinson's Disease?
Behavioral and Social Science

Mia Ramos
Grade:
8

Teacher:
Mrs. Lara Huetter

This project is about seeing if the Ketogenic diet helps cognitive ability in people with Parkinson's disease. I chose this project because my mother suffers from Parkinson's disease and I think this information could benefit her and many others who suffer from neurological disorders. My conclusion was that after a six week period of testing, compared to results before, she made significant improvement.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Interesting project, nice job!
Wow! My family member has PD, too. You sound very smart. I think you can cure the disease one day:)
Fascinating!
Fascinating topic; impressive, important results.  "Natural diet always beats medication.  Good to decrease carba-dopa even a little. I take carba dopa for something else & will try keto-like diet.
Wow, this is impressive! Hopefully you can expand this in the future ðŸ˜Š
Wow, great project! I hope you continue to further study the brain and help to find a cure for Parkinsonâ€™s one day.
Keep up the great research!!!!
Bright future ahead in your studies.
Nice job
Fascinating.  Maybe Keto might be the key for other neurological diseases.  You show that young students offer us hope for an incredible healthy future.
