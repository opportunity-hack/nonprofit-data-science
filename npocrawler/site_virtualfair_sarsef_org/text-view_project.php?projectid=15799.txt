Clean vs. Dirty
Energy and Environmental Engineering

I want to help the planet and one way to do that is to use more clean energy. My family uses solar panels as a way to help slow or prevent climate change. I wanted to investigate if there was a way to increase the production of energy made by our solar panels. I cleaned half of an array of our solar panels and left the other half dirty. Then I collected data from both the clean and dirty panels for 20 days. After looking at all of the data and analyzing it I discovered that cleaning your solar panels does make a difference. However, it does not make enough of a difference to risk injury to yourself or damage to your panels.
This project has been cleared by SRC.


Comments

Great use of data to draw conclusions.
I will not wash my solar panels! Thank you! wonderful presentation.
Great work!  You handled surprises like panel 4 and the rain really well.  Excellent data analysis.  What would more dust (like a haboob passing thru) have on your data?
Great information to know! Thank you! We'll start to clean out solar panels when we have other reasons to go up on the roof!
Thanks Grampy!
This project has a classic, good concept! You have really good data and observations! Good work!
Great project Claire.  Useful information.  Good to know.  Grampy.
