1. My project is about exploring the effects of algae on a controlled body of water. It consisted of two different amounts of said algae, to observe its changes that is created within a one hour time period.
2. I chose this project since we won’t have as much water available in the future as we do now, therefore we need to come up with ways to retrieve that needed water. With this project we test a natural solution for this issue.
3. As a result of the five trials, the algae had the predicted outcome, since it had raised the pH of the water anywhere from .2pH to .6pH. According to the data, when using a higher amount of algae compared to water there is a much bigger outcome.
4. The project tested is important since we test how beneficial algae can be to certain bodies of water. This will allow more water to be useable because this issue is getting much larger due to climate change. Without any other solutions we will run out of accessible and useable water, which by then a solution will be essential.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
