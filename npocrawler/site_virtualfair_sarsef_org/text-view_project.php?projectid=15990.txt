Charcoal vs Enamel ?

My project is about the damage charcoal toothpaste does to your teeth. I tested this by using eggs to represent teeth, and putting charcoal toothpaste, normal toothpaste, and no toothpaste on the eggs. I chose this project because I used charcoal toothpaste and I heard it could possibly harm your teeth. The conclusion I got was that charcoal damages and wears down the front enamel of human teeth. My project is important because millions of people use charcoal toothpaste and since it is harmful to tooth enamel many people could be severely damaging their teeth.
This project has been cleared by SRC.


Comments

Interesting investigation and well thought out. Was the same toothbrush was used for both samples? If so, how was it cleaned, to be sure none of the charcoal toothpaste got on the "no charcoal" egg?
