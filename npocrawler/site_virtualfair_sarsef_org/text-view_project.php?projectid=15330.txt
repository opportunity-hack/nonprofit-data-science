Fabrication of a Bioprinted Scaffold Cuff: Implications for Tissue Engineering of an Implantable Organ

I fabricated a scaffold cuff model to be used in tissue engineering for an implantable organ as well as analyzed 7 different bioinks to determine the optimal bioink composition for maximal stem cell growth on the scaffold cuff. The traditional use of a scaffold cuff is to encourage angiogenesis, or vascularization in tissue engineering, but the ideal future application of the scaffold would have a second purpose in addition to its initial role: to serve as a foundation upon which differentiated stem cells or nerves can mature, promoting desirable cellular interactions. Ultimately, the best combination of bioinks for the scaffold cuff model was the Cellink A-RGD-Pluronic F-127 blend, specifically crosslinked with the 0.57% Calcium Chloride solution, stored in a phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution. I chose this project for its extensive implications for the field of organ transplantation and medicine as a whole; discovering a way to safely and efficiently engineer synthetic biocompatible organs resulting in successful implantation may help meet ever-rising organ demand.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Wow, innovation at its finest! It starts with the printing of a Scaffold cuff and will pave the path for future bioengineering.
