Why Do Chickens Eat Their Own Eggs?

1.- My project is about Chickens eating their eggs and how to prevent it 2.- I have chickens at home, and one day I found out that they were eating their own eggs. I was interesting on why they would, so it was a good opportunity to learn about it and make it a project as well. 3.- The results of this project were a success the chickens did not like the mustard eggs which meant that the chickens will not eat anymore eggs. In conclusion now we have more eggs than we used to. 4.- This project was important because these are our chickens, and we want to make sure that they are healthy and do not have any problem laying their eggs.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Interesting concept about chickens and eggs! Crazy investigation - Venkata Manikonda
It's great to see you using your own observations to provoke an experiment!
Great that you did an experiment to solve a problem that you had and that you can immediately apply your findings to your own life.
Thank you for sharing this project with us - we're have at least one egg eater in our coop and it's frustrating to find broken eggs! We're going to try your mustard trick.
