I was testing to see if an herbicide made with vinegar, Epsom salt, and Dawn dish soap was effective enough to eradicate both young and mature weeds so that it can be used as an alternative to Roundup and prevent unnecessary exposure to the potentially carcinogenic chemical glyphosate.  I got this idea after watching a news report about a lawsuit against Monsanto, the manufacturer of Roundup.  I know that weed control is very important in agriculture, landscaping, and in home gardens so it is beneficial to test the effectiveness of different herbicides to see which one works best.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

good data collection
Great job!!  Well presented.
Great to find and use the NDVI meter to provide a numerical scale to go along with your observations. The combination makes for a good conclusion
