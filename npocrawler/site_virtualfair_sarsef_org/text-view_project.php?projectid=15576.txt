The engineering design project is a device which prevents javelina and other desert wildlife from becoming trapped in garbage or recycling bins. This project is important to me because I have seen wildlife struggle to get out of overturned garbage and recycling bins, and I wanted to help in a way that wouldn't put either wildlife or me in physical danger. Particularly in Arizona, wildlife face risk of injury or even death (due to heat and dehydration) if they cannot easily escape from garbage and recycling bins. My spring-loaded hinge device installs quickly, does not permanently alter city or trash service-owned bins, and it works to keep wildlife safe.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
