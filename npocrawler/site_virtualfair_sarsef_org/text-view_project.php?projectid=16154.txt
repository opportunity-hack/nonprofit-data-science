Smell This-How Do Different Scents Change a Dog’s Behavior?

Angela Hitt Class
Grade:
4

Teacher:
Angela Hitt

Our project consisted of having dogs smell various items and recording their reactions. Fourth graders brainstormed topics that they wonder about and decided that they wanted to know more about how dogs react to scent. We observed 9 dogs in our teacher’s neighborhood and recorded their reactions to the items we voted on. We found that most dogs initially sniff an item. Some dogs seemed more interested in the items by sniffing them longer or trying to take the item. The owners of these dogs said they also have big appetites. Some dogs who ignored the items were also said to have small appetites. Overall dogs prefer the scent of dog treats the most based on their reactions. They seemed the least interested in hard candy. This project is important because we learned what dogs respond to by using scent. Certain smells could be used to attract or detract a pet to/from something. A question we still have is: Can dogs sense danger by using their sense of smell?
This project has been cleared by SRC.
