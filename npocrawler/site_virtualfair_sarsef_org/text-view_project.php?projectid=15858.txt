Does the color of water affect the color of the flower.  Students are studying plants and plant life and it showed how the plant absorbs water to survive. The majority of thought that it would affect the color, but some did not.  We were able to show how water travels through the plant's system to keep all parts alive.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
