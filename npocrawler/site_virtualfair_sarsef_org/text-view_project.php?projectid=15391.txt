I will be measuring how much pollution a car gives off while idling at a stoplight.  I chose this because I am interested in cars and how they work to make safe and healthy intersections. Stop lights are better than stop signs but worse than stoplights for the environment.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

This is a very interesting project. I was really surprised by your results as well! Now I understand why so many roundabouts are being built! This kind of research can help save the planet!
