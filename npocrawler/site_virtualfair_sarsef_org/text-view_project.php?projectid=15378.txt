My project is about how different types of flours affect the density of a loaf of bread.  I chose this project because one of my interests is baking!  When I was trying to come up with a creative and unique idea for my science project I wanted to make it fun for me to do so I made a project out of one of my hobbies!  The results from my experiment showed that gluten free flour resulted in the densest loaf of bread.  The second densest was whole wheat flour, followed by all-purpose flour, then bread flour, and lastly cake flour.  All-purpose flour, bread flour, and cake flour were shown to be insignificant when compared to one another.  My project is important because it helps give proof of some of what each flour will result in for bakers who are trying to choose between these flours.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
