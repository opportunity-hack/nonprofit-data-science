HS-BE035
The Correlation of Self-Perception and Meeting New People
Behavioral and Social Science

Angelica Loya
Grade:
HS

Teacher:
Elyse Wexler

My project explores how self-perception affects people when meeting new people. I decided to explore this topic in hopes of helping people who may want to know why they act a certain way socially around new people. My results proved that most people who had a negative self-perception, had a low confidence. My project is important because it can help people figure out why they act a certain way around new people and how their self-perception affects that.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
