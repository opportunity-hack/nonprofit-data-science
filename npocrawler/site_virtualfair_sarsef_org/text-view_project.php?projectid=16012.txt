The Relationship Between Ambient Temperatures and Cognitive Ability

This project focuses on the effects that temperature has on the mind while doing certain tasks. I choose this project because it was a question i had pondered to myself a few times. The results proved that the mind is negatively affected as the temperatures get warmer. This will benefit society by providing knowledge about the effectiveness of learning, just by staying in ideal temperatures.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
