pH Indicators from Tucson Plant and Fruit Extracts
Chemical Science

This project is about seeing if certain plant extracts from plants commonly found in the Tucson area, could e used as a pH indicator.

I chose this project because I am interested in chemistry and the composition of desert plants.

The results of this project were that two of the plants produced a greater number of color concentrations than the other two.

The concepts from this experiment could be applied to effluent testing, gardening and the making of dyes.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
