This project is about how different acidic supplements for citric acid in a bath bomb will effect the time of fizzes.  We choose this project because we thought it would be fun to see the chemical reaction of a bath bomb with different materials that would replace the citric acid in a bath bomb.  Our over all conclusions is buttermilk pancakes mix is the longest lasting bath bomb out of vinegar and cream of tartar.  Our project is important because citric acid is damaging to your skin.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
