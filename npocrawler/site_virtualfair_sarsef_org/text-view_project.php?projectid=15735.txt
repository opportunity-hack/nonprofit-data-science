The Problem of the Etch - A- Sketch
Engineering, Robotics and Computer Sciences

Zoe Larsen
Grade:
3

Teacher:
Mabel Rivera

I have an Etch a Sketch but the problem is that the drawing leaves.  I wanted to create my own Etch a Sketch that keeps the design. I wondered about what is inside an etch a sketch. If I want to keep my drawing I need to find something that will save the drawing.  The materials will be both technology and house hold item.  The programming will be done on a Micro Bit, Breakout board and with a Servo.  I have been involved in Girls who Code in the past and I love coding projects.
