Since the COVID-19 pandemic started, kids have a hard time remembering to social distance 6 feet.  I wanted to design and build a wearable device that lets kids know when others are too close. My device was sewn into an arm band.  It vibrates and lights up when others are too close.  The lights are green when you are in the clear, yellow to warn when others are getting closer, and red when they are within 3  feet.
