Pollinators in Our Neighborhoods

We wanted to know which pollinators are most attracted to things that we put in our gardens like plants, hummingbird feeders, and bird baths. We chose this project because we love nature and it was safe to do during the Covid pandemic. The results were that bees and wasps (96%) as well as hummingbirds (96%) were the most frequently located by things we put in gardens. This project is important because some pollinators are in real trouble right now and gardeners can attract them by creating gardens.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
