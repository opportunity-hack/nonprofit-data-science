My research project studies the effects of sunlight cycles and exposure on the bioluminescence of microscopic marine dinoflagellates. I chose this experiment because bioluminescence has the potential to create more sustainable lighting in urban and suburban areas by implementing the chemical reaction that takes place into typical plants such as trees. Overall, my experiment concluded that the complete light exposure group performed best in 3 out of 4 of the times collected while the group that cycled between light and dark exposure performed best when the data was collected at noon. This experiment is significant because it helps us to better understand the nature of bioluminescence which can then be used in developing more sustainable lighting. Next steps in this research include figuring out how to maintain the Light/Dark level of brightness at noon throughout the entire night.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
