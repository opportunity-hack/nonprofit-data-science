Physics, Astronomy, and Mathematics

Ansley Rundle
Grade:
6

Teacher:
MariAnn Slater

1.My project is about finding out which surface is best for drawing on with a pencil. 
2.Why I choose this experiment is because I wanted to find out which surface would give my drawing the best image quality. 
3.The final result of this experiment was that finished hardwood is the best surface for drawing on with a pencil. 
4.Why my project is important is because it will help other artists determine the best surface for their art studios or desks.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
