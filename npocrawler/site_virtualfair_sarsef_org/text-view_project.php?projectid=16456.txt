Where Is My Egg?
Chemical Science

Adam Norzagaray

I am 12 years old and I am in 6th grade. I live in Tucson Arizona and I go to Borman K-8. I like to help my mom when she bakes. I thought it would be funny if I could make a see-through egg to trick her.

Research question: Can I create a see through egg with liquids I found in my house?
This project has been cleared by SRC.
