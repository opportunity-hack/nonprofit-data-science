My project is about how to make a self powered bike light better. I chose this project because I love electrical engineering and it is a passion of mine. The project overall was to determine which combination of motor and LED would make the perfect mix. This is important because it can decrease the amount of battery consumption and waste.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
