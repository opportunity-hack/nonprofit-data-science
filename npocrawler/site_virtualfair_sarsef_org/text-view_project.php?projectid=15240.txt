K-HW001
Can Blowing Bubbles Spread Germs?
Health and Wellness

Lilah Winter
Grade:
K

Teacher:
Megan Winter

This student is in Kindergarten at Manzanita Elementary (CFSD). She is a homeschool entry because they do not do science fair for kindergarten.
Due to Covid-19, she has had lots of questions about the spread of germs (viruses, bacteria, etc) during typical childhood activities like blowing bubbles. She’s very curious about the possibility of being outside and more than 6 feet from a friend, and germs traveling between friends in bubbles that are blown. She wonders- “Can blowing bubbles spread germs”? She found that her mouth germs traveled in her bubbles and that blowing bubbles can spread germs.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Fantastic job. I hope you continue to ask such questions.
I never thought about whether bubbles spread germs. What a great idea. Thank you for conducting this research!
I love that you did an experiment to see if blowing bubbles with friends from far away is safe during a pandemic.  Great job!  I loved reading your project.
Now this is a good one
