Arizona is home to incredible wildlife. Of particular interest to me are the native fish. Drought, fire impacts and climate change have driven these native species to the brink of extinction. To keep the diversity of our desert we must defend and protect all species, especially fish in their natural habitat. Gila topminnow, Gila chub and Longfin dace are all endangered or threatened native fish of the Sonoran desert. I propose a fish-saving water pumping windmill. First, we must identify native refuge fish populations, ideally in shaded plunge pools. We must protect these fish in their natural habitat by insuring their water source does not dry up. To do this, I propose using a windmill to pump water when the creek is running into a storage tank. The pools must be monitored. In times of need, the stored water will be released into the refuge pools.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Keep up the passion for wildlife.  I learned something new today about aquatic life at risk.
