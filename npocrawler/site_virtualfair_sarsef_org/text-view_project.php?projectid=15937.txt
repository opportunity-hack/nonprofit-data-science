I choose this project because when the pandemic first started disinfectants were selling out everywhere out and people kept buying more disinfectants. This project is important because right now there is a virus called COVID-19 and it is deadly so people buy disinfectants to help clean surfaces and protect themselves from the virus. and think that the disinfectants is the best disinfectants to clean the virus.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
