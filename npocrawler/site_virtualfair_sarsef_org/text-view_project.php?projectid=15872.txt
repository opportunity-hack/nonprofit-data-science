The switch to online learning was a difficult transition for both students and teachers.  Our project based learning and hands on lessons were traded for Zoom sessions and virtual activities.  After a while we noticed that it was becoming more and more difficult to stay focused during zoom meetings. Participation was down and students reported feeling tired and distracted.  We decided to test a few different strategies to help increase our focused during synchronous learning
This project has been cleared by SRC.
