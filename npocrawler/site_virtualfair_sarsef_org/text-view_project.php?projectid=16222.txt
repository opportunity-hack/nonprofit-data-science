This science fair project answers the question; how does the most effective household sound proofer from my first experiment, terry cloth, compare to store bought sound proofers? The topic was chosen for my previous experiment because many people enjoy watching television or listening to music loudly and the sound traveling into other rooms can bother others. Besides those who like peace and quiet, others who might find this topic helpful are people who live in a big family and those who design movie theaters, libraries, or schools. The problem of unwanted noise can happen almost anywhere. Most people live with someone else or share a workspace with others. If someone is living or working in a noisy environment, it may not be good for their mental wellbeing. They can become frustrated or angry due to the unwanted noise (Kallio 28). My previous experiment stated that terry cloth is an effective choice for inexpensive sound insulation, but does it absorb the same amount of sound as a material designed for that? Soundproofing an area should not have to be expensive or difficult, but could make a big difference in someone’s day.This experiment was designed to help people keep noise contained.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
