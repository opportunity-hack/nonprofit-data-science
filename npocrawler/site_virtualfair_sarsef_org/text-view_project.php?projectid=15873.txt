Which brand of toothpaste will eliminate more bacteria from your mouth.  With the pandemic, and passing around of germs, we were wondering if toothpaste helped decrease the germs in your mouth. We found that some kinds of toothpaste did a good job and others did not.  The cost did not determine which one did best. The project is essential to know what toothpaste will help with dental hygiene and spreading of germs.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
