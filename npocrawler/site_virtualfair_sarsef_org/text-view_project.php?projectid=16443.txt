The Crystal Project
Chemical Science

Grade:
7

Teacher:
Ms. DeLaGuerra

Borax was used to precipitate crystals by putting a pipe cleaner in Borax with blue paint or Borax with purple food coloring to see how each material added to Borax would affect crystal growth. The paint produces less crystals of larger size and the food coloring produced more crystals of smaller size.
Key words

This project has been cleared by SRC.

So my question is why? Can you give any reasons for your results and conclusion compared to your hypothesis? What kind of paint did you use?

Leave a comment. Comments will not be viewable until Friday, March 5th.
