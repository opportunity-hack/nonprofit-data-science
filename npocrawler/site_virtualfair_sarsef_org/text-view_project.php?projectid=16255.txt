Differentiating Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells Into Nephron Cell Types Using Extracellular Matrix Proteins and Soluble Growth Factors

This project investigates how specific microenvironments can cause stem cells to differentiate into different types of cells. My research contributes to the eventual goal of creating a patient-specific kidney from scratch, which would make donors and immunosuppressants unnecessary. Using my data, which I collected using databases, and my research, I planned out combinations of extracellular matrix proteins and soluble growth factors to differentiate stem cells into different varieties of nephron cells. Nephrons are the main functional units of the kidney.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
