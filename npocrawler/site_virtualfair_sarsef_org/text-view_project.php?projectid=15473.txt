Gloves + Gaming = Better?

In this project, different types of gloves were tested to find out how wearing them affected gaming performance. Could they increase or decrease performance or make the player's experience better? As a gamer, it was meaningful to me to find out the results and see how wearing gloves could affect players. I discovered that while the fingerless gloves I tested showed better overall performance with the players' scores, players' opinions did not always align with the results I recorded. I believe based on the scores results that there is a benefit to utilizing gaming gloves.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

So what do the gamer gloves cost? Worth the investment?
