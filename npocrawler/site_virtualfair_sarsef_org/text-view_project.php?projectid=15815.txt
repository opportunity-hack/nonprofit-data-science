For our project, my partner and I built a trebuchet. We did this project because we were interested in trebuchets and how they work. This project could be applied to the real world by moving heavy objects from place to place with ease, and accurately throwing weighted objects. It took several attempts at building the correct design due to some flaws in the finished prototype. We had to change the sling design many times and added more weight to the counterweight. The materials to create the prototype were fairly simple:  2x4’s, steel bar, wood screws, weights, paracord, and power tools. 
Once we created the prototype, we had to move it to a safe location to test it out.  The sling turned out to be the biggest hurdle of the whole design.  We started with a bandana, but the objects kept getting wrapped up in the sling.  We changed it to a sling made out of duct tape, then a paper bowl, a plastic bowl, and then a rectangular plastic container.  We cut the sides of the rectangular container just a little bit, and that allowed the objects to fling from the trebuchet as intended.
We used several different light-weight objects (foam baseball, softball, golf ball, and volleyball) to test the trajectory and distance of the trebuchet.  Due to safety concerns, we did not test heavily weighted objects. with stronger building mechanisms, we predict that we could send larger objects greater distances.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
