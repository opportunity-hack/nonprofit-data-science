Liquid vs. Snickers
Chemical Science

My Science Fair project is about a Snickers candy bar going into 5 different liquids and seeing how the Snickers reacts to all of them.
I chose this project because it seemed very interesting and I noticed that when you put cotton candy into water it dissolves very quickly, so I thought I would try that out with a hard chocolate candy bar and use more than one liquid to test it out.
My overall result was that the water dissolved the chocolate bar the most. I was surprised with that result because I thought Sprite would dissolve it the most.
My project is important because you can learn from it and do it in other ways to improve it.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
