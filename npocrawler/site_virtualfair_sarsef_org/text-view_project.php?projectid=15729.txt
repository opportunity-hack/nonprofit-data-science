Old Dog New Tricks ; Helping my Grandpa
Health and Wellness

Grade:

Teacher:
Mandi Cordell

I’ve always heard that an old dog can’t learn new tricks. My Grandpa is old and stuck in his lazy ways, but he is very social and has great stories. So, I want to see if I can teach him new healthy tricks by combining exercise with his strength of being social. Maybe I can even TRICK him into enjoying exercise by engaging him in good conversation?
This project has been cleared by SRC.

This was a very sweet and caring experiment. It's nice that you and your Grandpa enjoyed quality time together while doing a healthy activity.
I love how much you care about your Grandpa and that your science project was about engaging him in exercise!
The vision and mission behind this project is inspiring
