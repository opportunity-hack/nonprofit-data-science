Effects of Yoga on Student Learning
Health and Wellness

Monique Berry-Kelley Class
Grade:
4

Teacher:
Monique Berry-Kelley

For this project we wanted to find if yoga could have a positive impact on student learning. We chose this project because a lot of students were having a hard time passing their Xtra Math Daily fact practice. We found that for many students yoga helped them relax, focus and improve their score.
This project has been cleared by SRC.


Comments

This experiment certainly has real-world applications that many of you will be able to benefit from! I'm curious what other factors might have influenced the results from student to student.
