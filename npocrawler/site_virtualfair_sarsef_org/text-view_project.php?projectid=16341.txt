Could an athlete preform the same or better in cleats meant for a different sport? The purpose of this experiment was to compare soccer and baseball cleats in speed and accuracy. After the trials were preformed, it was concluded that the baseball cleats had better average kicking precision, but the soccer cleats yielded a faster overall average. One could use soccer cleats while playing baseball, but an athlete should not use baseball cleats during soccer because
of the their metal spikes.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
