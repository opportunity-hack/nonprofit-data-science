What Material Makes the Best Parachute?
Energy and Environmental Engineering

Grade:

Janice Mason

I took home materials and made them into parachutes to see which one makes the best material.   I thought parachutes were fun to watch, so I wanted to make my own.  The towel made the doll drop the slowest, so it was the best at home material for a Barbie.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
