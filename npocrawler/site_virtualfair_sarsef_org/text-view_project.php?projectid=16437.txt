The Moon Matters

Jessica Howe Class
Grade:
2

Teacher:
Jessica Howe

In this project, we explored how the phases of the moon affect our classroom hamster, Simba. We chose this project because we noticed how our classroom hamster was more active some days and more sleepy on others. We concluded that hamsters are more active when the moon is full. This is important because it’s valuable to understand your pet and it’s behaviors so that you can take care of it well!
This project has been cleared by SRC.
