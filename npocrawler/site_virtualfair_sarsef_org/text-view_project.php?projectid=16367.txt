My project is about which brand of water bottle can keep my water cool for a long period of time.

I chose this project because I wanted to know what brand of water
bottle keeps my water cooled. 

The results were unexpected because hydro flask won on average.

My project is important because it can help someone when buying a
water bottle and they want one that will keep it the coldest on a hot
summer day.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
