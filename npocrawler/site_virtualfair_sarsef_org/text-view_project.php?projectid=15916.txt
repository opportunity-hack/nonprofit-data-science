How can we melt ice on roadways without polluting the surrounding land.  When people use salt it seeps into the ground and much of this land produce vegetation that we eat or other animals eat that we consume. I found a product, BEET JUICE, that melts ice better than salt and is and will not contaminate the ground.   Too many additives and contaminants are entering our food source, so we need to find ways to stop it.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
