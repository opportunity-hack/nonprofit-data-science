The Hidden Menace: Microplastics in the Santa Cruz River

I am looking into simple and cost effective methods for microplastic identification in water. The issue of microplastics is effecting life worldwide and needs to be dealt with. I found that there are methods using coffee filters and a cheap $10 microscope on Amazon. These methods will mean that citizen science can be utilized to analyze samples easily and potentially uploaded to give scientists a large database to work from.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Congratulations on your $50 Energy Solutions Award for expanding Citizen Science in this important area of research!
Great work! As an Environmental Educator, I could really use information like what you tested to help create great programming for my students.
