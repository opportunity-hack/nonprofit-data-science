In the end my original prototype worked quite well and matched all of the requirements. The only one it struggled with was grass though this was less to do with what I was testing with and more to do with cut grass getting caught in the wheels. I know the cut grass was the problem as on the strip without cut grass there was little to no issues with the car. The rest did well despite this.
