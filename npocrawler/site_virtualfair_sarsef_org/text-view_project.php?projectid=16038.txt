I want handicap people in wheelchairs to be able to ride in a boat safely, this idea should keep the wheelchair from rolling around. After thinking through this I came up with my engineering problem to solve.
This project has been cleared by SRC.


Comments

I know a real life mechanical engineer that wanted to tackle this same problem with a new, better design a few years back.  Not sure what they came up with, but I'm going to send this to them now :)
