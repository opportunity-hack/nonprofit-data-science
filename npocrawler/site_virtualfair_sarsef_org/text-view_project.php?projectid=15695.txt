My project is about the process of hydroelectric energy. I chose this project because it sounded quite fascinating to make your own dam to see how the flowing water would make energy.  My overall conclusion is that depending on the flow rate of the water you can get different amounts of energy.   My project is important because it shows the process of hydroelectric energy in a simpler, easy to understand version.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
