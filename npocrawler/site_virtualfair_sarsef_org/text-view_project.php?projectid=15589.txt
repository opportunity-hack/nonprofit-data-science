My project is about the bacteria in ponds throughout Tucson, Arizona. I choose this project because my grandparents have a pond and I've always been interested in the wild life in it. The results of this project was that the two private ponds I tested had more bacteria than the two public ponds. This project about private and public pond bacteria is important because it can show if ponds need to be cleaned more.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

What a great and gross project! I wonder if the public ponds do anything to reduce the bacteria like treat the water? Would be an interesting thing to research!
Good execution of the experiment.
