Our project is about prosthetic materials and substitutes for those materials.
We chose this project because were fascinated with prosthetics and how they build them, when I grow up, I would like to be a prosthetics engineer and make a prosthetic that is more affordable and the same quality as a more expensive prosthetics. 
 My result for the experiment is that wood would be the best material for a substitute to more expensive materials like aluminum and titanium, even heavy-duty plastic.
My project is important because not all families can afford prosthetics, I’m talking about the families with veterans that have become disabled due to a loss of a limb in the line of duty, I’m also talking about the families that have a disabled child from birth or have a child with an amputated limb.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
