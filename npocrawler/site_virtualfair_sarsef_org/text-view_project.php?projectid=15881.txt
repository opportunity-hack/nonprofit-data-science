Keep Your Food the Way You Want It

We created a lunchbox that has two sections that keep one section cold and the other warm. We bring food to school for lunch and some should be cold, but others warm and our current lunch box you only have one choice  Our conclusion is that you can have it both ways.  This gives people the opportunity to bring multiple items for lunch at different temperatures.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

What a great prototype you built! You really solved a problem a lot of people have! I like that you tested both compartments over a 6 hour period with a thermometer. Next time maybe with food?
Nice job.
