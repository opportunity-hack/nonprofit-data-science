1.My project is about how pH of water changes when the water is repeatedly distilled. 
2. I chose this project because I thought that there was more to learn from pH and based on my experiment I was correct. 
3. My overall result was that after being distilled once, water becomes alkaline, after being distilled twice, water becomes slightly acidic, and after being distilled  three times, water becomes neutral.
4.  My project is important because much of the Earth’s water is sea water and distillation cleans the water; distillation also makes the water the correct pH for drinking, which is where my project comes in.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
