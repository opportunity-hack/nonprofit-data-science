1) My project is about harnessing the wind energy generated by traffic on highways and using it as a power source to fulfill various energy needs.
2) I chose this project because I wanted to find more ways to use clean sources of energy and reduce pollution.
3) The result of my experiment was that It's possible to harness wind energy from the moving traffic and use it as a power source.
4) My project is important because it uses renewable source of energy and helps to save the planet Earth by reducing global warming and solving the problem of energy crisis by large extent.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

battery performance? Would you expect any difference?
Wow! What a cool project!
