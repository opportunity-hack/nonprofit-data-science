My project is about the amount of time people play video games.  I chose this project because I love video games.  The overall conclusion was that my hypothesis was incorrect, and playing with a parent worked better than tracking your time.  My project is important because playing a lot of video games can be unhealthy.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
