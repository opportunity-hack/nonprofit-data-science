My project is about separating colors.  I chose this project because I wanted to learn how many colors are in each color.  I discovered that brown and black have the most colors.  Chromatography is important because you can also separate gas and liquids.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

What a fun project! I love all the colors and the artwork you created with your experiment.
