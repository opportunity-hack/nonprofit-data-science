Plant Warfare: Investigating Allelopathy

Mrs. Yewell

This project seeks to answer the phenomenon of which plants contain general allelopathic effects that prevent seed germination by other plant species in order to maintain their growth space? We chose this project because we had observed that plants need space to grow and we wanted to know what plants would do to obtain their grow space. Our conclusion is that while some of the plants we explored seemed to have allelopathic properties such as the cabbage and the broccoli, all of the plants had some allelopathic effect on each other due to the plant additives into the soil with the exception of the control groups. Our project is important because we learned about allelopathic properties that plants can have (including invasive species) and how they effect our environment.

Comments

Great, easy to read, colorful graphs
Great photo documentation. Those photos really bring the experiment to life in a way that data tables just can't do. Great visual effect.
