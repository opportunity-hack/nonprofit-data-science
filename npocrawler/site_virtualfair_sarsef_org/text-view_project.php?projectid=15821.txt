Mask Up! But Which One?

I tested which mask would be more effective in preventing the spread of germs. I did this
because I feel it’s important that people know the best ways to stay safe during this time.
Throughout my research, I learned how germs spread and the right way to prevent spreading
COVID-19. My independent variables were the type of mask and the distance from the lighter
to the mask. My dependent variable was if the flame would go out or not. My controlled
variables were the type of lighter and how hard to blow through the mask. My hypothesis was
that depending on the mask I wear, the flame will either go out or not because the masks are
made from different materials. The materials for this experiment were 1 lighter, 1 surgical mask,
1 fabric mask, and 1 ruler. First, I put the surgical mask on my face and made sure it fit nicely. I
put the lighter 1 foot away from my face, and tried to blow out the flame three times. Since my
results were inconclusive, I decided to move the lighter closer little by little until I was able to
blow it out or until I couldn’t put it any closer. I recorded my results, and repeated all of this with
the fabric mask. My results are that the surgical mask is more effective in not spreading germs.
This is because the tests of the fabric mask from one inch away were able to blow out the flame.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
