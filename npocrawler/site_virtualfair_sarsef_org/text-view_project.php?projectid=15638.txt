My science fair project is an in-depth exploration into the inner workings of a pepper. The project mainly focuses on how we measure spicy levels with capsaicin, TrpV1, and dilutions. From lovers of spicy foods to people who like it sweet, this project can teach you something new about how this unique food works. In a human versus machine test, my experiment determined that machines can more accurately determine taste than humans can.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
