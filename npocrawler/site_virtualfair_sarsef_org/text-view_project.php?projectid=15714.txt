HS-PS013
Effects of Different Fertilizers on Pinto Beans
Plant Science

Tesfamichale Fekadu, Ruta Rezene
Grade:
HS

Teacher:
Elyse Wexler

Our project is about how the different fertilizers we've accumulated has an effect on the pinto beans' height and growth rate. We have come to a compromise to choose this project because it provides intel on the best fertilizers to use for faster growing plants. Our result was "Ensoma Holley Tone," one of the best recorded fertilizers in our experiment, which increased the height of our Pinto Bean by nearly 3 cm more than average. This project is important because it has the solution to modern day problems such as: The modern day food crisis, starvation, and food insecurity in low income areas.
