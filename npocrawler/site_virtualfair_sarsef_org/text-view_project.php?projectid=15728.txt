This project looks at the question Which type of floss removes
more inter-proximal plaque from teeth?
I chose this because plaque removal from the teeth is important in the prevention of oral disease.
When comparing the plaque removal of the different flosses there were no trends that would indicate superior plaque removal.
This study is important because gum diseases such as periodontal
disease have been linked to heart disease and diabetes.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
