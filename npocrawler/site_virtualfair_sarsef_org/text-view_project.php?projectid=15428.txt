Great Experiment on Skittles! Super Innovative - Venkata Manikonda
I have always wondered whether there were more yellow skittles in a package. Thank you for doing the hard work to answer that question!
I liked your experiment. Orange is my least favorite flavor and I always thought there were too many oranges in a box.
