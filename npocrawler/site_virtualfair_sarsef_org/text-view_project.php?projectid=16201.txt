This project is about the effect of earthworms in garden soil.  I like to garden but don't like adding fertilizer to the soil.  I wanted to see if earthworms could enhance the growth of my vegetables better than commercial fertilizer.  My results proved that earthworms are better than fertilizer.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
