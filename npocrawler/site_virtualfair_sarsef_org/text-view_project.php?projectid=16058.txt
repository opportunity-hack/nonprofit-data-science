My project was about finding the best fabric layer combination to use in cloth face masks (the efficacy to shorten the length at which air could be blown was tested in eight total different combinations of fabric layers). I chose my project because I was interested in having a project that was related to this ongoing pandemic. I found that the one layer of cotton lawn and one layer of 100% cotton jersey knit fabric combination had the best efficacy. The results of my experiment proved that cloth masks are effective at shortening the length at which air can be blown, as well as providing some information about what fabric layer combination is best for preventing longer-distance air-flow.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
