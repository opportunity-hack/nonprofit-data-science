HS-PS014
Germination of Beans Using Magnetized Water
Plant Science

Isaiah Hernandez
Grade:
HS

Teacher:
Marelis Vazquez Rivera

My project was about germination of pinto beans using magnetized water.  I chose this project due to my interest in magnetized water and its benefits. My results were that the tap water actually did better than the magnetized water. My project is important because it was testing to see if the magnetized water actually had benefits on germination.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
