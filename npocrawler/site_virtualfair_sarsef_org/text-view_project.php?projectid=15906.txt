Must I Dust?!?!

I have noticed that there was an air purifier in my classroom and in some other places now, so maybe this project will help other people to get dust and germs out of the air in their rooms too. About a year ago my parents bought an air purifier and my first question was “will I be able to dust my room less now??” I came up with the idea of putting an air purifier in my room to see if the air purifier will help get dust out of my room because I hate dusting my room. I was very inspired to do this because there is so much stuff on my shelves and is is very annoying to clean some of it. So if this works I won’t have to dust my room as much.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

I really like that you used two different kinds of measurements!
I liked the completeness of your project.  And your conclusion was good.  I don't like dusting either!  Good job!
Great job Alex, This is very interesting and a great subject.  I don’t like dusting either...
