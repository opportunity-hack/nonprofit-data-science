Welcome to the virtual exhibit hall
Welcome to the 2021 SARSEF Regional Science and Engineering Fair Exhibit Hall! Here you will find the top 15% of all student science and engineering projects in the Southern Arizona region. We are so proud of all the students who completed a project this year, especially in the midst of so many challenges. We are in awe of you and all that you accomplished.
Look at all the critical thinking and problem solving that is happening in our community!
Using the filters, you can browse by category or grade, or even use the keyword search to narrow down to a specific special project you are looking for! Keep noticing and wondering!
