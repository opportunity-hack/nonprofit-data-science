Methods to Reduce Water Evaporation?
Earth and Environmental Sciences

Ana Batiste

This project investigates organic additives that reduce the rate of water evaporation. This is important to me because I enjoy cooking and want to know how water evaporates in different recipes, and to help conserve water in the desert. I learned that additives which raise the pH level will reduce water evaporation. This might help reduce evaporation in desert water supplies by keeping a higher pH in storage tanks.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
