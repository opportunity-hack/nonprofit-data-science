My project is about Reducing my family's carbon footprint.
 I chose this project because I wanted to do a climate related project that makes small changes but a big difference in our family's effect on climate change. 
I was able to reduce my family's carbon footprint by 33% which is 16,095 pounds of carbon.
 My results had to do with the tweak we did as a family , we had to make good habits on saving electricity and gas. 
 My project is important because it relates to the real world it might not seem that big but it makes small changes in our family and a big difference in our planet.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
