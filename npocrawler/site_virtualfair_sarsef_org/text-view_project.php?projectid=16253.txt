This project is about which baking surface, stoneware, glass, non-insulated, or insulated, bakes cookies most efficiently when used. This project was chosen because I enjoy baking and people should find more energy efficient and environmentally friendly ways to bake. My overall conclusion was that the insulated baking sheet was most efficient. The stoneware was the least efficient. This project is important because a considerable amount of energy is used by ovens and we need to find ways to reduce how much energy we consume.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
