1. My project is about what makes concrete stronger, more or less water.
2. I chose this project because I thought it would help me understand the future job I want.
3. My results were that both broke when the 10 lb. hammer hit at 9mph.
4. It is important because it teaches me about my future job and something to look for in case of a problem.
