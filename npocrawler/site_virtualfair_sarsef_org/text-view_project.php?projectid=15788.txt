My dog has a bad habit of nudging me while I complete school work at home. She nudges me until I pet her. So, I created an invention that would give her the attention she needs so that I was not being interrupted during remote schooling. This is important because many kids face the same issue while having to learn at home, and it can make it difficult to focus on school work.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
