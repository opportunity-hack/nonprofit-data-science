This project is about how calcium affects bone strength. I chose this project because I wanted to see how the amount of calcium in bones affected how much force it took to break them. From this experiment, I concluded that the more calcium the bones had, the stronger they were. This project is important because it shows people how the amount of calcium content in their bones can affect their bone strength.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
