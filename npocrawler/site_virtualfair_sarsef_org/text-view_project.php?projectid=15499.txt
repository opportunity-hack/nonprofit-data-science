What Is the Yummiest and Healthiest Treat?

My project is about finding out what dog treat is the yummiest and healthiest out of my three treats Blue Dog Bakery Perfect Trainers, Rachel Ray Burger Bites and Greenies Dental Treats. I choose this project because I wanted to do a project with my dogs. My result was the Rachel Ray Burger Bites was the healthiest with 11 healthy points and the yummiest was the Greenies Dental Treats. My project was important because I wanted to know what treat my dog thought was the yummiest so I could feed them it more often and I wanted to know which treat was the Healthiest so I could focus on using that treat so they stay healthy while still having a treat thats yummy.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
