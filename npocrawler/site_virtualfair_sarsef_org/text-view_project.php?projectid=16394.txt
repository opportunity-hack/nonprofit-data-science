This project is about finding differences in opinion and knowledge of the electoral college between swing state and non swing state voters.
I chose this project because I enjoy learning about voting and topics related to voting.
I found that there was no overall difference between swing state and non-swing state voters.
I think that this project is important because a larger study about the electoral college could piggyback off of it and this is a very conterrvital topic.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
