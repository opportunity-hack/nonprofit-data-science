My project is about determining whether wearing a disposable surgical mask reduces oxygen levels. I chose this project because during COVID a lot of people wear masks, and some people were worried about it affecting their oxygen levels. I wanted to find out what affect masks have on oxygen levels. I found out that wearing a mask either lowers your oxygen level by a very small amount or not at all. This project is important because if people know that wearing a mask doesn't affect your oxygen level, maybe more people will start wearing a mask or won't be worried about wearing one.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

I really like your clearly defined experimental question, and your methods address it very directly.
Good job!  Great presentation.  Even though your hypothesis was not proven correct you proved it with facts!
