1. I'm performing this experiment to find out which type of flooring makes a basketball bounce the highest. I’m doing this experiment because it will affect how well a basketball player can dribble and play basketball.
2.  I did this project to figure out which surface is better for playing basketball on because I like playing basketball.
3.In this experiment the highest average bounce was the concrete surface at 37.8 inches.
4.This project is important because it will help people know which surface if better for playing basketball and help with ball control.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
