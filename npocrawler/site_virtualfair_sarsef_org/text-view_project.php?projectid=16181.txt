The Effect of Duct Tape on Puncture Resistance
Chemical and Material Science

Grade:
HS

Teacher:
Michael Frank, PhD

My project was on how duct tape affects the puncture resistance of styrofoam. I choose this project because I have seen people use duct tape for a lot of things; some being very complex. Furthermore, I was interested in how much duct tape would be best for avoiding puncture when being used for those more complex projects. From my experimentation, I found that sixteen layers of duct tape is most beneficial for maximizing puncture resistance. My project is important because it shows that duct tape makes a noticeable difference in puncture resistance.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
