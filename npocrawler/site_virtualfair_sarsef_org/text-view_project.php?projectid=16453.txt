Pop Rocks & Soda Experiment

This project is about an experiment conducting different flavors of pop rocks mixed with different flavors of sodas to create carbon dioxide, filling balloons with air. I chose this project because it sounded interesting, and I wanted to see if it had an effect like mixing mentos with coke. The result of the project was successful because we got good reactions out of the experiments. My project is important because it's informative and can be useful because of the physical reaction.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
