This project looks at how water can have different densities and will behave differently due to that change. I chose this project because I wanted to find out if I change the saltiness of the water will it affect its
density? I found that the water became dense when the salt was added to it. Since the world is mostly ocean, if we ever needed to we might be able to drink it if we understood how to separate the salt from the water.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

I like the way you changed things up with the colors to be able to see your results better. Science is about reacting to our data. Keep sciencing!
Thank you for creating an experiment that asked and answered a question.  Good work!
