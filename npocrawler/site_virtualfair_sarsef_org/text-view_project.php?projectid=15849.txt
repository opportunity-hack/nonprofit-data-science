6-CH009
Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) and Electroplating
Chemical Science

Stone William McCaleb
Grade:
6

Teacher:
Joe Beard

I chose this project because it sounded interesting to learn about electroplating and pulse width modulation.  

My conclusion is that Pulse Width Modulation at 50% and Pulse Width Modulation at 75% were more efficient than non-Pulse Width Modulation, and look the same.  

It is important so that we know an efficient way of electroplating.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
