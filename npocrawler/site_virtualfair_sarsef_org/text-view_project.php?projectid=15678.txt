We wanted to engineer a prototype of a personal bank that would encourage people who have trouble saving their money a method in which they could save. We chose this project because lots of people like spending their money and this will help them to not spend every penny. After several modifications, we were able to design and engineer a prototype that sends a light shock (the same as static electricity) through your hand if you place it in the Block the Bucks! bank. This project is important because it can help people to make decisions that will financially benefit them by not spending their money on items they want, not that they need. If people need to access their money for an emergency, there is a spending side of the bank that they can access.
