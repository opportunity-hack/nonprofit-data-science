I am a 6th grader at Borman K 8 in Tucson Arizona. I have always love to watch cooking and baking shows. I have baked with my mom we have made Banana bread, a few different types of muffins, and brownies. I am doing this because I love baking and I would like to know what different baking ingredients do to any type of bread.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
