1.My project is about aircraft flight
2. I chose this project because before I was always fascinated about airplanes
3. My conclusion was that the planes with the shorter wings flew a little bit highter
4. I think it is important because we can see what we can do better about aircraft flight
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Wow! Unexpected, I love it.  So if I want my plane to do more tricks, stick with long wings.  Distance and straight, shorter wings.  Cool :)
