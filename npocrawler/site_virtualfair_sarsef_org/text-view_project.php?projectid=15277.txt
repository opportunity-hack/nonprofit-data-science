camera, wildlife, Corridors, drainages 
my project is about using wildlife cameras to determine whether wildlife travel through storm drainages and whether wildlife corridors have higher wildlife traffic than storm drainages in Tucson.
It seems interesting since we live in an area where we can find a lot of wildlife in our washes and it gives them a safer way to travel. 
pending results. 
It can show us data that if animals actually use these as cross ways.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

I really enjoy how you implemented the ideas about storms here - Venkata Manikonda
How fun to catch our beautiful wildlife in action. (Amazing picture of the roadrunner). I’m surprised more animal didn’t use storm drains, I would think they may feel safer like in a den. Now I know.
What a fantastic project! If you are still checking your cameras, consider submitting your them to Sky Island FotoFauna! You can learn more about FotoFauna here: https://bit.ly/2PwvNw9
