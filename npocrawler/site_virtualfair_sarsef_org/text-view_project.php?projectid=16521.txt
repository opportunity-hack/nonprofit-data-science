In this experiment I tested to see which renewable energy source worked best and was the most efficient. Not many people know how useful renewable energy is or which one is the best. Therefore, This experiment helps to identify how much volts

 each energy source is and which one is the best of the three.

I did this project because I've always liked doing energy type science projects and this year I wanted to challenge myself and also I noticed all these fields of windmills or Solar panels and sometimes watermills and I wondered how much energy is made from these.

The average volts for the water energy was 21 volts. The  average volts for wind was 24.4 volts. The average volts for Solar was 28.7 volts.. 

 Not many people know how useful renewable energy is or which one is the best. Therefore, This experiment helps to identify how much volts

 each energy source is and which one is the best of the three.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

This was a very interesting project using your homemade turbine and using different sources of energy to turn it.  Good Work.
