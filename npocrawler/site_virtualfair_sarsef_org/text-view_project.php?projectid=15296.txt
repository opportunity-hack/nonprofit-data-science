The continued misuse of antibiotics to treat disease has created a worldwide problem, and has led to the rise of antibiotic resistance. This research evaluates antibiotic resistance in the human oral microbiome in relation to three different disease types. These are- Type 1 Diabetes, Cardiovascular Disease, and Pregnancy Complications. Overall, this research found a correlation between most Antibiotic Resistance Genes found in the oral microbiome and the genus types associated with the disease types.However, this was with the exclusion of three genus types, which was surprising. This may be related to confounding factors such as Horizontal Gene Transfer or environment.  Further research should be done to characterize whether certain patients are receiving antibiotic treatment in order to better understand its role in the human oral microbiome and human diseases. This research is important to understanding the intricacies of the human oral microbiome and the factors to its composition.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
