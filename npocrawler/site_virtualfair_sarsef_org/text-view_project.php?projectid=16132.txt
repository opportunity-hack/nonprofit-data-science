For our project, we engineered bird feeders in an attempt to bring more birds to our community. We chose this project because after a virtual field trip to the Arizona Desert Museum, our students took interest in the topic of birds and the preservation of birds in our community. Overall, we had mixed results with the success of our feeders but the students were able to think critically and find reasons as to why some bird feeder designs were more successful than other. For example, they found that bird feeders that were hung from trees had far more seed eaten from them than feeders that were placed on the ground. Our project was important because it not only gave our 2nd graders the opportunity to experience the engineering process and the use of prototypes. It also addressed a topic that is important to our community. As Tucson's population grows more and more open land is being developed and many species of birds our losing their homes.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
