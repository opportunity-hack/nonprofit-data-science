Health and Wellness

Ingerson, Barker

My project is about what mask should we wear. I chose this project so we know what kind of  mask to use. My conclusion was that the polyester mask was best. My project is important because then people can be safe and know what kind of mask to use.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
