Sabina Vaswani Class
Grade:
5

Teacher:
Sabina Vaswani

Due to the Coronavirus, we went fully online at the start of the school year, which made
learning a challenge. Instead of attending school in-person, we were reliant on
technology to complete our school work. We attended Zooms throughout the day, as well
as, completed assignments on Google Classroom. Due to the heavy use of technology,
we noticed our eyes were getting tired and decided to research the effects of lighting on
our eyes. We decided to participate in a series of Math and reading tests in the morning
and evening. The tests were created according to our grade level and we analyzed the
results after the data collection.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Impressive research! Maybe students are more tired at night?
