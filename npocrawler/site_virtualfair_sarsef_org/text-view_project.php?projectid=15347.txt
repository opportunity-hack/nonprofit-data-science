I was researching topics to do then I stumbled upon this interesting subject. The topic talked about how music can help to improve a students’ performance. I then decided to put it to the test since if this worked out this could possibly help tons of students do better in school especially during these hard times. I then decided to perform the experiment based off these two problems. 1. Can listening to lofi music help to retain memory? 2. Can listening to music be beneficial to students while taking exams? After thinking of what problems, I wanted to investigate I came up with the following procedures. First, I would download the music app Spotify to play lofi music in the background. Next, I would attend class as usual taking notes but with the aid of music. I then would repeat these steps alternating between listening to music and not listening to it. After a couple of weeks, I would compare the test results of all the test I took. After I had finished my experiment, I had these results. I had an average of 93.3% with the exams I took with music. Meanwhile, I had an average of 89.71% with the tests I took without music.  In the end it turns out that music is helpful to students who are struggling or just want to perform better in their classes.
