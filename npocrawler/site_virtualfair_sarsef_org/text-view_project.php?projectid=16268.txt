Which Nail Polish Best Resists Chipping?
Chemical Science

Ana Diaz-Lucio
Grade:
8

Teacher:
Sang Lee

My project is about founding out which nail polish works the best and is the best in resisting chipping. I chose to do this project because I always found that the nail polish I wear always ends up chipping and I wanted to find the one that lasts longer without chipping. The conclusion of my project was that the nail polish Essie was the best resistant in chipping. This project is important because it helps people save money and invest in a good product.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
