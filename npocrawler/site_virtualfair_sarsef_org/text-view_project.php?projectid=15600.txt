This project is about slime and what about slime is important. I chose this because it sounded fun and I like slime so I thought it would be good to learn more about it. In conclusion, I learned that slime is not just for playing with. It can also come in many different textures. This project is important because it shows that slime can be used in different ways.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
