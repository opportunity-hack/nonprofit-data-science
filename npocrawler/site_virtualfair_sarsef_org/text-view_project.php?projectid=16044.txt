The Friction Prediction

For my project, I designed simple ziplines and simulated a rider to find which line material would allow for the least amount of friction. I chose this project because I wanted to learn more about how ziplines work and why they work, as I’ve had lots of fun with them in the past. I found that fishing line has very little surface variation, and my rider was, therefore, able to glide the quickest on it. I think that this project, scaled up, can help us determine whether zipline technology is a viable mode of transportation and if it is how we can best implement it.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Great work. Adding the bell was a nice innovation to make sure you knew when the "rider" hit the wall!
