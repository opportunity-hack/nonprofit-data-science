"I love to blow bubbles! I have many different bubble solutions and wands. I even have a bubble machine. However, every bubble I make is round (spherical); and every bubble wand I own has a round hole.Can bubble wands with rectangular, triangular, or oval shaped openings makes bubbles with those same shapes?
"
This project has been cleared by SRC.


Comments

I bet trying to get bubbles out of the triangle shaped wand was frustrating! Cool project and would love to see why the shadows are colored as well.
