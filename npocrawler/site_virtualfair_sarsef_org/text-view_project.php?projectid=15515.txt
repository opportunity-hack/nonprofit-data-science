Should You Be Stressed About Salt Stress: Does Increasing Salt Content in the Water Given to Mung Beans Negatively Affect the Growth in the Plants?

Grade:
HS

Teacher:
Elyse Wexler

This project is about the effects of salt added to the water of mung beans to see how salt stress would affect the growth of plants. I chose this because i know that salt stress is dangerous, but didn't know how dangerous it would be to plant growth. The result was that the more salt added, the less the plants grew, showing that salt stress is harmful to plant growth. This is important because it shows the effects of salt stress on the growth of plants, and could show agricultural communities how dangerous salt stress really is.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
