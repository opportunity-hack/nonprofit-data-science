Which Mask?
Health and Wellness

During this dreadful pandemic, many people are having to wear masks everywhere they go. It is very hard to find the right mask that allows comfort and a good amount of oxygen. For example, when playing soccer (with a mask on) I noticed how quickly my energy levels decreased. I also noticed how hard it was to breathe. So, I decided to do a science project to answer everyone’s question “Which mask allows the most oxygen intake?”
Keywords:  Oxygen, Secretions, Diseases, Protection
This project has been cleared by SRC.
