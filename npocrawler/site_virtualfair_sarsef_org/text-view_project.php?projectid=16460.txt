Which Color Best  Encourages Plant Growth?
Animal and Plant Science

Alec Gallardo
Grade:
7

Teacher:
MariAnn Slater

1. My project is about determining the best LED color LED light to grow plants with without
using natural light.
2. I chose this project because I like to grow plants and Botany is a very interesting topic to
me.
3. My conclusion to my experiment showed that the Yellow LED light had the best growth
on the plant totaling in at 78 cm.
4. My project is important because when it gets cold the plants tend to freeze, and then we
don't grow any product, but we can resort to using LED lights to grow the plants.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
