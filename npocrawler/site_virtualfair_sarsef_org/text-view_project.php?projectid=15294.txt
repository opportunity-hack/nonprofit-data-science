HS-AS002
Inequity Aversion in Dogs
Animal Science

Khairudin Ahmad Fahim, Cesar Garcia, Jaziel Rodriguez
Grade:
HS

Teacher:
Jeremy Jonas

We tested inequity aversion in dogs. We chose this project because we found the topic interesting from videos of Dr. Frans de Waal. We found that dogs do have inequity aversion. Its important because it helps us better understand the behavior of dogs and how they think. It also will show us how animals cooperate with each other, and if they care for each other.

KEYWORDS: 
inequity aversion, pets, animal cognition
This project has been cleared by SRC.


Comments

Graphic presentation of data would be a nice addition.
I did not expect that!ðŸ¥² Oh my word, so sweet that one dog would be upset for the other!! No wonder we can use these compassionate animals as companions for ourselves!
