. This experiment aims to help people more effectively handle flies. I wanted
to test different baits to see which type would most effectively catch common house flies. I
found a fly pheromone bait, a food-based bait, and a bait with both food and fly pheromones. I
predicted that the combination bait would catch the most flies; and that the food bait would do
better than the pheromone along because only males are attracted to the pheromones. I cut the
tops off water bottles and adhered the inverted tops to the bottle to create rudimentary fly traps. I
filled the traps with the baits and put them outside for one week, rotating them through four
locations around my house. This was repeated for four weeks, every other month, over a six
month period. The combination bait traps had higher masses every week when compared to the
food and pheromone traps. The food traps also had higher masses than the pheromone traps
through almost every trial. My hypothesis was supported by evidence because the combination
bait caught the most flies and the food bait caught more than the pheromone. This data can help
benefit the field of agriculture because it shows how to best manage flies
This project has been cleared by SRC.

This was an excellent project.   I especially liked that the project came out of your own experience and will be useful.
