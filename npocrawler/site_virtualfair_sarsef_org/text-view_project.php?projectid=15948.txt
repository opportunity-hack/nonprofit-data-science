What is your project about?
My project focuses on the recent wildfires in Australia, California, and when i did this project, recently a fire on Mt. lemon near me. What my project focused on because it's a sequel is How does height affect the cone of drop, because you might want to land in a specific area.



Why did you choose this project?
I had done this project last year, so I wanted to make a sequel, and I know of the things happening around the world.


What was your result/overall conclusion?
I found that the higher you go, the bigger the cone of drop, so it's harder to hit a certain area if you are very high, but is good for planting an area of shrubbery and trees.


Why is your project important?
I don't believe that my project in its current state can do much to affect the greenery, but if I improve more with more biodegradable materials that I may soon make more darts with seeds to replant lost forest and shrubbery.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
