I wanted to find out which thermometers are more accurate, a Galileo Thermometer or a digital thermometer.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

I like how your research brought about more questions than answers. More science to do!
Good job at incorporating so many variables.  You encouraged me to research the Galileo Thermometer, which was very interesting.  Excellent work!
