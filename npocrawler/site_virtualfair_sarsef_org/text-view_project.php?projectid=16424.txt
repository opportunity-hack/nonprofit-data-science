Our project is about bridges (building and breaking them).
We chose this Project because it looked fun and interesting.
Our hypothesis was correct because the Popsicle stick and glue bridge was the strongest.
Our project is important because we need to understand how to build strong bridges.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
