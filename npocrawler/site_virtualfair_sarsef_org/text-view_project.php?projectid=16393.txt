My project “how effective is retro-reflective gear” was meant to find out how effective retro-reflective gear is, so I experimented with distance and data to see. I chose this project because so many pedestrians and bikers die every day out at night because they are unseen by cars. My result is mostly pictures and data, but I have proven that retro-reflective gear is very beneficial to the safety of people out at night. My project is important because it proves that wearing retro-reflective gear can save your life.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
