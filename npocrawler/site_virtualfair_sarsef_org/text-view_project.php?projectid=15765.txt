When Is the Park Most COVID-safe?

I like to play at the playground at my local park. I also want to stay safe during the COVID-19 pandemic, which means avoiding the playground when it is crowded and when many people there are not wearing masks. For this project, I counted the number of masked and unmasked people at my local park every two hours during daylight hours each day for one week. I found that the less busy (and thus more COVID-safe) times to visit the park are mornings, weekdays (as opposed to weekends), and cloudy or partly cloudy days (as opposed to clear days).

Key words: COVID-19, pandemic, masks, social distancing, physical distancing, Himmel Park, playground, face coverings
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Great project! You chose a real question that you had to answer and got great results. Very well done.
A very timely project - great job! This was a very important topic and you did very well showing your results. Your graphs were excellent. Overall, job well done!
I liked your experiment. I think it's important to know when to go to the park.
Good work
