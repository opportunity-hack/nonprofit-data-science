Which Voice Assistant Is the Best?
Engineering, Robotics, and Computer Science

Mia Leimroth, Darren Yong
Grade:
8

Teacher:
David Ficke

In general, our project is about voice assistance and where they stand in relation to each other as of 2021. 
We chose this project because we were interested to see which voice assistant is the best (Google Assistant, Alexa, Siri, Bixby).
We found the Google Assistant has come the farthest, and was able to answer the most questions.
Our project was important because it determined the most advanced voice assistant out there today.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

I always wondered which was best, thanks for doing the research and this project for me! I prefer using Google Assistant, but enjoy Alexa's sense of humor the best. Great job! - Judge Tom
