This project was designed to test the brain's ability to catch subtle changes when the focus is on another task. We designed an experiment in which we changed the prices of an item we were selling without saying anything, and we tracked how many people noticed the small change.  We chose this experiment because we wondered how if most people frequently miss small details in their daily lives. Our data implies that the human brain frequently misses small changes. This is important to further our knowledge of the human brain and determine what is normal behavior.
