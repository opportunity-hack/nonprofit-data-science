The Stable Brace

My shoulder consistently dislocates. I am trying to find a better way for my shoulder to be more stable in a brace. Something similar to this brace exists without a strap going around the brace. The CFR Shoulder Brace Rotator Cuff Compression Support Strap is a similar product. My modification was adding an extra strap to go under my armpit. Everything went well except for the sewing which was tricky. I can improve my prototype by putting flexible plastic so I can get more movement .
