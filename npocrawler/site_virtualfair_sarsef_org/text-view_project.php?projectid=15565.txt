The project is about a smart automatic dog feeder that can be controlled by a smartphone, Alexa, and or a Google Home. I chose this project because I forget to feed my dog on a regular basis. The result/conclusion ended up with a smart automatic feeder that dispenses anywhere from 5-6 cups of dog food each time it is turned on for one minute. My project is important because if more people use this to replace the normal dog bowl, less dogs will die from hunger every year saving millions of dogs lives. Keywords: Smart, Automatic, Dog, Feeder.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
