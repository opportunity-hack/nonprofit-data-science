The purpose of this project is to help children who behaviorally walk on their tiptoes. If these kids continue, then they will have to have corrective surgery to their ankles and legs. My older sister had to have this surgery, and my youngest sister walks on her toes as well. I want to help her to improve herself.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
