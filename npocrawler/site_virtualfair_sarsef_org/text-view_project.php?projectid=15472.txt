Ms. Wermuth

I want to explore how cellphones impact us on a daily basis. I plan on experimenting with actual screen time usage by seeing if turn off notifications and or turning phones to gray scale can decrease usage and increase more time devoted to school and interacting with others.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
