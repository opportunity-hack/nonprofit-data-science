Will mistletoe will grow back after it has been
pruned? A year and a half long study will tell me.

I want to save trees. Mistletoe destroys trees. We get O2
(oxygen)from trees. We will not live without trees. I am
worried about the trees dying because of the mistletoe.I have
mistletoe at my house on some trees and my grandparents’
have some too. My one and a half year-long project took
place at my grandparents’ house. My grandpa wanted help
with his mistletoe problem. That made me curious to see if I
could help save his trees.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Nice job! Good use of photos and like further thought for next time but wonder about how tree would do with all the chemicals?
Great project! You chose a real question that you had to answer and got great results. Very well done.
I learned a lot from your project! You had a very interesting topic and provided great details. Your procedure was excellent and your photos were great. Job well done!
Also, I thought your project title was creative and catchy!
A standing ovation for working on a project for 1 1/2 years. That is incredible. As you can see, sometimes science doesn't happen overnight - it requires lots of time. Good for your perserverance
Good job working on a project that you have practical application for. I hope you get rid of that nasty mistletoe
