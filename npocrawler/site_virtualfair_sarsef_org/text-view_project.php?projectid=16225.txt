Two Slits, Three Slits, Red Slits, Green Slits! The Triple Slit Experiment
Physics, Astronomy, and Mathematics

Grade:

1. This project is about recreating the famous double-slit experiment that proved that light is a wave, and adding another slit to see the result. 
2. I love physics, especially learning about light, quantum things, lasers and optics, space, stars, black holes, pulsars, and all astrophysics and planetary geology!
3. The triple-slit experiment showed a similar interference pattern to the double-slit experiment, but there were three light waves interacting instead of two, so the areas of constructive and destructive interference were slightly different. The red laser's interference pattern was wider than the green laser's because it was a longer wavelength of light.
4. I can show fundamental truths about physics and the universe just by using things I have at home! I may not understand all the mathematics yet, but I can still do a lot with my current level of knowledge, and I learned a lot more in the process!
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Great project!  I enjoyed reading your project.  It was nice that you learned from your test results.  Great job!
Well done project! I like the effort you put into making the slits. I'm sure it wasn't easy to do but you made it work very well. Good luck with your future research!
