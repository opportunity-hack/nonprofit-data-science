Copper: More Than a Penny,
Health and Wellness

Grade:

Our project is about what the benefits of copper can provide for humans.  We chose this project because we are interested what the earth’s natural resources can be transformed into.  In conclusion, copper is a hidden everyday resource in many people’s lives and impacts them by improving their health.  We believe our project is important because we are informing those that may not know how beneficial copper is and how it really is more than just a penny.
This project has been cleared by SRC.


Comments

Interesting literary review on copper. Copper is often used for water pipes. Do you think that copper pipes might dissolve some copper into drinking water?
