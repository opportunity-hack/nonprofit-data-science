HS-AS014
The Effects of Air Quality and Temperature on Bat (Chiroptera) Emergence Times
Animal Science

Isidora Mandolini
Grade:
HS

Teacher:
Elyse Wexler

My project is about the relationships between atmospheric conditions and the time that bats emerge at night. I chose this project because I wanted to study an animal of some sort, and Tucson has a large bat population. My overall conclusion was that temperature does not affect bat emergence times, but air quality does. My project is important because it hopefully spreads awareness about bat conservation and how certain atmospheric conditions impact bats.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
