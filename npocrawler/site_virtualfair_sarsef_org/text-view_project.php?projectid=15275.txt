HS-EA004
Restoring Fragile Landscapes Revisited: Investigating Seedball Germination Rates In Situ
Earth and Environmental Science

Grade:
HS

Teacher:
Jeremy Jonas

My project is about finding the most effective way to help restore fragile landscapes using seedballs. I chose this project because I saw research that was previously conducted using the same methods, yet it wasn't conducted in the field. My results showed that there was little germination (less than one percent) when seedballs were used in the field, most likely due to the season this was conducted in (winter). My project is important because landscapes in the Southwest are being degraded due to vegetation undergrowth and cows overgrazing/walking on this land.

Great photographs and fun comment about the missing seedball.  You have to wonder what animal found a toy to play with.
