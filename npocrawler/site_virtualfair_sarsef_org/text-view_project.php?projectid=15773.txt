Have you ever bought a carton of strawberries, rinsed them, then gone back to the refrigerator two days later for a refreshing snack only to find they’ve gone bad? I know that’s happened to me! That is what made me want to run this experiment. I have heard of several different ways to keep strawberries fresh. Which one really is the berry best?
This project has been cleared by SRC.


Comments

I e had that question too!  Thanks for doing the experiment
This is a very applicable research project.  Nice job.
Good job using the freshness chart. Great way to keep observations consistent and to have a way to give a numerical score, which is easily to analyze that simple observations
Very good observations and an experiment that will help us all in keeping our fruit fresh.  Good job!
