Our project is about testing some ones ability to identify real and artificial smells. We chose do this project out of the curiosity of the bodies functioning. Our result was varied which was what we were hoping for and everyone had different answers or struggles. Our project is important because it could help people realize if they have a limited smell pallet and they can choose to explore it for themselves.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
