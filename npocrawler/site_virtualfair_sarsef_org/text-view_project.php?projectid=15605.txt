Meet Your Meat: My Investigation of Meat Tenderness
Chemical Sciences

Lucas Raymond
Grade:
5

Teacher:
Denise Ybanez

My project is about finding the perfect temperature to cook pork meat at for maximum tenderness. I chose this project because I find food science interesting. I wanted to measure and quantify something usually guessed at in the kitchen, learn about the chemistry involved, and use the industry standard Warner Bratzler test method to understand cooking better. My overall conclusion is that roasting pork at about 300° F produces the most tender result. My project is important because it will help people be more successful at creating delicious meals at home and in restaurants, saving food and making smiles.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
