This project is about making snowballs quicker, more efficiently, with equal size, and without getting your hands cold or wet.    I chose this project because I wanted to make a device to make snowballs without having to touch the snow.  A snowball took twice as long to make by hand than with the device.  Snowballs made by the scoopers were more round,  compacted, and worked better when thrown.  Using a Snowball Scooper will help kids not get frostbite on their hands.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
