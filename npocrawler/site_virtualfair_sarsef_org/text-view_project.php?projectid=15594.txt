My project is about which saddle pad will keep a horse cooler. I chose this project because I love horses, and riding horses. I also noticed that after I ride, the horses are really sweaty. My conclusion was that a cotton saddle pad will keep a horse cooler than a wool saddle pad. My project is important because you can keep your horse more comfortable while riding, which might make them less likely to act bad, if they act bad.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Great that you did a project that had a clear application for you. I like how you used and placed the thermometers to get your readings. Good job!
