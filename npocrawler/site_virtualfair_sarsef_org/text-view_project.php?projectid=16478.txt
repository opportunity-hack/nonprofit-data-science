Will Homemade Biodiesel Be an As Effective Fuel As Canola Oil?

My project is about testing to see how homemade biodiesel made using canola oil would compare with regular canola oil by putting both in alcohol burners to see which one would last longer and have a bigger flame. 

I chose this project because I found the usage of biodiesel interesting and wanted to see if it was possible for homemade biodiesel to be effective. 

My results showed that the biodiesel was more effective at keeping a flame alive than canola oil with an average of 15.33 minutes while canola oil had an average of 1.742 seconds. 

My project is important because it can act as a demonstration of how biodiesel can be just as good of a fuel than non reusable fuels.
This project has been cleared by SRC.


Comments

Good chemistry in this project.  My only question is why did you not add similar chemical to your canola oil as you did with your waste oil?  What would have happened then.  Good Job.
