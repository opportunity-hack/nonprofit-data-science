I am a 12 year old 6th grade student at Borman K 8 school in Tucson, Arizona I started to like gardening in the spring of 2020 My brother was the one who inspired me and showed me tips and tricks on how to garden in pots Soon After that, I began to plant produce from onions, to apple seeds, from pumpkin seeds to green beans I am doing my science experiment because I have grown other produce, but never have successfully grown a potato tower to reproduce into more potatoes I am very curious to find out if it is possible for me to plant a potato and then reproduce into more potatoes from the exact same potato plant.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Great job, you are now a gardener!  Given more time, I bet your potatoes would reproduce they sure grew well and you took great care of them :)
