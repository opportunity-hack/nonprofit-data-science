Alexandria Vaughn

What is your project about? My project is  about how bleach and ozone affect e-coli and candida.




Why did you choose this project? I chose this project because all my parents are nurses and doctors as well as my grandparent and aunt.



What was your result/overall conclusion? Bleach works better on a Candida while ozone does about the same damage to the e-coli to the bleach. I should also mention we had petri dishes and you may be asking why so many and that is because we have Control which means it doesn't have any disinfectants. 



Why is your project important? This can help other generations in tough times stay safe and healthy and make sure people have a good alternative like ozone.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
