The project was mainly about using simulated human corpses for fertlizer for trees. I tried using fertlizer that included pork meat at simulated human remains. The plant didn't germinate with that fertilizer, but it did work with the control fertlizer. It's important because it's helps with both deforestation and overcrowding in burial grounds.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

What an original idea!
Very unique project!  Great job!
Interesting project. Keep expanding your concept.
Great idea to solve a worldwide, real problem. When I saw the name, I didn't quite know what to expect. You really thought through this idea. The pork could have been really smelly. Keep it up.
You have a good sense of the environment and the future challenges we face. Good luck with future research!
