The Effect of Caffeine on Mealworms
Health and Wellness

My project aims to measure the effect of caffeine on mealworm growth. Mealworms are easier to work with in a study rather than my other idea, which was to train our dog to test for color blindness. My results shows too much caffeine resulted in weight loss and mealworm death. This is an important study that shows the impacts of too much caffeine on health, and it would be interesting to do this study on humans, who also consume caffeine.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Good job reflecting on your results to consider future r
Interesting that the instant coffee group started out the lowest weight and ended up the heaviest. Do you think that too much caffeine might be a problem for the mealworms?
Great job on your experiment. Keep up the hard work.
This is interesting. We put coffee grounds in our compost. I wonder if it discourages earthworms from living in our garden.
Great project and topic! Your photos were a great addition. It was clear you put a lot of work into your project. Way to go!
Your reflection at the end of your experiment is thoughtful.
