HS-BE038
Effects of Stress on Procrastination in Teenagers
Behavioral and Social Science

Grace McCool
Grade:
HS

Teacher:
Elyse Wexler

This project focuses on if increased stress can increase how often a teenager procrastinates. I chose this because I struggle with procrastination, and I know many of my peers do as well. Overall, it seems that stress does, in fact, have an impact on how often a teenager procrastinates. The project is important to me because it helped me figure out a reason as to why I and other teenagers procrastinate so often.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
