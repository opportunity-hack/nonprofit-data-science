Our project is about building a lunar city. People have always wanted to have a chance to live on the Moon. Living on the Moon can always be a challenge, that’s why a lunar city will use different engineers to help figure out how to live sustainably. The Moon’s resources can be used to live sustainably on the Moon and people can learn about those resources and how they can help people on Earth. This projects offers a design that shows people how to utilize different natural resources from the Moon to live there successfully. Keywords: architecture, radiation protection, regenerative agriculture, sustainable, resourceful, artificial intelligence.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
