1st Place Grand Award, Best Female Project, 1st Grade, TEP Award of Excellence

1-PM003
Connecting With Electricity
Physics, Astronomy, and Mathematics

Myla Closterman
Grade:
1

Teacher:
Mrs. Bangert

The project is about what kids of objects complete electrical circuits. Are they insulators or conductors? The project was chosen because we have a circuit building kit and got curious about what can conduct electrify and what canâ€™t. I learned that metal objects connect electricity and non-metal ones do not. And that salt water is a better conductor of electricity than fresh water.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Your diagrams and presentation are very clear. They helped me understand your experiment and your results much better.
You are one of the smartest 1st graders ever
