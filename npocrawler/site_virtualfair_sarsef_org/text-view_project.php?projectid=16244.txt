Sponge or Dirt : Where Can Seeds Grow Better?

Ms Clark

We grew cilantro seeds in both sponges and dirt to see which would be a better growing environment. My partner and I wanted to see if sponges would work because they hold more water and could be a way to save water when we grow plants.The plants in dirt grew taller and faster, but the ones in sponges grew too.Because water is a scarce resource, especially in the desert.Keywords: plants,dirt,sponge,water,cilantro
This project has been cleared by SRC.

I wouldn't have thought to test growing seeds in a sponge, but it makes sense. Very clever project!
Very useful idea to have two people do the same experiment. I liked the detail and nuance of the analysis you could do because you had 2 people.
Great project! It was great to add the fun fact about cilantro! Also, your graphs were well done and easy to understand. Job well done to both students!
