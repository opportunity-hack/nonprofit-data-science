My project is about geothermal energy and geothermal powerplants.  I chose this project because I wanted to do a challenging project and the project I chose was about geothermal powerplants and energy.  My result was that when I put the can  on the foil it produced more stem that when the can was no on the foil.  My project is important because it can provide data and research for scientists an inventors on how to utilize geothermal energy and find more ways to use that natural energy.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
