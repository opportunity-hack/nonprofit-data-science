This project determines the volume of water trapped within a dog‚Äôs coat when swimming in a pool.This is important in Arizona due do the amount of pools in residents‚Äô backyards and pets that swim in them.  It allows the owner to see how much water is lost due to their pet(s).
This project has been cleared by SRC.

I like how you created a data table and graph to show your results and how you creatively found a way to get Cooper into the pool.

How fun to include the family in your experiment. You did a good job of creating questions and building on your project. Great job!
