I came up with this idea because my mom plants a lot and was wondering if there is a better way to make the plant in the bag grow taller by changing the water. I think when you change the water every day the humidity will be very little and it won't grow much. So I think that when I change it 3 times a week it will be in medium humidity so it will not grow tall but higher than 1 time a week. finally I think that when I change the water 1 time a week it will grow tall because it will have the most moisture.
This project has been cleared by SRC.


Comments

good observations
Beans were a great choice. They grow fast and they are large enough to easily observe.
