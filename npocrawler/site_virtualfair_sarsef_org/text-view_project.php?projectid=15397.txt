HS-EA016
Measuring the Oxygen Levels of Yuma County Water Source from Fall to Winter
Earth and Environmental Science

This project will go over the amount of dissolved oxygen (DO) that exist within water sources that are sourced from Yuma, AZ. The data collected from these water sources have been monitored from fall to winter. ?

This project was conducted using the following methods. First, in order to take accurate readings in our DO reader, we must calibrate the sensor. Secondly, we submerge the DO reader into the water source and leave the device in the water as it reads the temperatures of the water sources. Then press the MODE button to switch the readings to dissolved oxygen. Levels of oxygen were?

?

The results of the experiment showed that as the seasons began to change, the temperature began to drop, as the temperature dropped the amount of oxygen present within the water samples increased. The temperature of said water sources does partake in the amount of DO present within the water samples.?

?

In conclusion, based off the results, our hypothesis was correct, throughout the course of this experiment the DO levels have increased as the weather began to drop during winter.?
This project has been cleared by SRC.
