The basis of the project is going into how to create a levitating device using the eddy currents generated through magnetic induction. I chose this project because I am interesting on levitation and the way magnets work. The result of the project was unsuccessful due to the fact that I was unable to get the motors to spin fast enough. This project is important because it can help get get closer to faster transportation.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
