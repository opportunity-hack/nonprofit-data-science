Designing bird feeders out of recycled material that attracts more birds to our neighborhood community.
Bird populations have diminished since 1970 across nearly all habitats in North America. Having a diverse bird population is part of a healthy ecosystem, and with many avian populations are declining across Arizona. Our students wanted to support our community by drawing more birds to the Tucson area. 
It was determined that feeders that were more open in design and used a source of fat like peanut butter in their design were more successful in attracting birds to their communities.  We learned that when working with animals the results can be very unpredictable. We can construct a creative design but that does not necessarily mean a bird will chose to eat from it.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Didn't understand how essential birds were until now. The work and time put into this definitely shows as well. Awesome job!
Good experiment on birds! I like how you were able to implement so many ideas here - Venkata Manikonda
Thank you for inspiring proactive approaches to important issues in the world!
I applaud your desire to do something for wildlife and to use recycled materials for your feeder designs. A great combination
I really like the idea of celebrating each design. One never knows when a design that doesn't look like much might be the ideal design.
