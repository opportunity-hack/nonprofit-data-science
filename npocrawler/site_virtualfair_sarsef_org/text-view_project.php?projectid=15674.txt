Wipeout!
Health and Wellness

We both wondered whether Clorox Wipes or Lysol Wipes would clean better. Based on our research, we discovered that phones are one of the dirtiest objects we touch everyday. We both agreed that we thought the Lysol wipes would clean better than the Clorox. We chose this project because now more than ever, it is important to keep surfaces clean of germs, especially an item such as a phone that people put on their face. In conclusion our hypothesis was right. We thought that Lysol wipes would clean better than Clorox wipes. We thought this because we did research and saw that Lysol wipes are one of the strongest antibacterial wipes. This project is important because germs can make people really sick and knowing how to prevent illness is important.
