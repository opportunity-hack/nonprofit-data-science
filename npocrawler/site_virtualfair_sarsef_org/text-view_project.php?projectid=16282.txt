Combating Acid Rain in Arizona Lakes

Acid rain is very harmful to humans, animals, the ecosystem, and even metal in high enough doses. In my experiment, I found out that limestone greatly raises the pH of water, and any bodies of water that are not near any limestone will have a much higher acidity. It is also shown that stagnant water will gradually raise in pH, shown by the rise from a pH of 3.7 on day 0 to 3.9 on day 5. This is useful to know for scientists in the future who want to reduce the amount of acid rain inside of an ecosystem.
This project has been cleared by SRC.


Comments

Interesting project! Is there value in raising the PH of Teddy Roosevelt Lake? Would it be a good idea to introduce limestone to it to make that change? Has acid rain reduced the lake's PH over time?
Good job. Keep Thinking, Keep Researching, Keep Testing
