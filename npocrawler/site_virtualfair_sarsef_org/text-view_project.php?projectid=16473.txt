For this project we are researching theories and current cures for cancer, then coming up with a machine prototype that can improve the cures and how they are applied to the cells. We chose this project because I was curious how cancer is a very known disease that over the years has still not had a consistent resolution. Our solution was a machine that would use flexible needles to insert a vaccine directly to the infected cells. Our project is important because it can help give a new perspective on this disease. Words: Cancer, Machine, medical, research, cell repair
This project has been cleared by SRC.
