My project was about not having to turn off the light, so making something
that could do it automatically for me. I choose this project because I was
always forgetting to turn off the lights when I leave, so I just made something
to turn it off for me instead. I made my automatic light switch that when I sit
down, it turns the light on, and when I get up, it turns the light off. My project
was important to me because I basically could never remember to turn off the
lights and I Really wanted to do something about it.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
