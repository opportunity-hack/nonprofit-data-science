Does Wearing a Mask Affect Oxygen Levels?
Health and Wellness

Madeline McCabe
Grade:
8

Teacher:
Mrs. Lara Huetter

My project is testing if masks affect oxygen levels while doing little to no exercise. I chose this project because masks are the most effective and easily accessible way to protect yourself during the pandemic, but some people say that masks lower oxygen levels making them dangerous. My results are that wearing a mask slightly lowers oxygen levels, but nothing less than 95% which is considered dangerous. My project is important because masks are now mandatory in some places and it is important to make sure masks are safe to do little to high exercise.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
