OO-Bleck A Non-Newtonian Fluid
Physics, Astronomy, and Mathematics

This project looks at the behavior of a non-Newtonian fluid when it is made with liquids of different densities.
I chose this because OO-Bleck is the coolest stuff ever. I thought that OO-bleck made with tap water would drain the quickest but it didn't.
I think this project is important to learn how substances behave under different conditions. It might help me engineer something some day.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

I love colloids!
I Love Colloids, but never thought to make it with different liquids.  Great Job! Fun project.
