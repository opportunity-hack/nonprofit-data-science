My project looks at the effect different types of music has on plant growth. I chose this because there are many studies about how music in general can positively affect plant growth and I was curious if the type of music mattered in results. I think my project is important because it could help plants/plant based foods grow better without the use of things that could be harmful to people or the environment. The result of my project showed that pop music had the most positive effect on growth.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Wonder if it works on people, too?
Great idea! I like that you included the names of songs in your report. Your photos really help tell the story. Now I know that Taylor Swift helps plants grow, in addition to being a great musician!
