Rachelle Ferris Class
Grade:

Teacher:
Rachelle Ferris

Due to technical difficulties students and teachers are often left to use other clues to figure out what is being said and to communicate including lip reading. We consulted our School Speech Language Pathologist to get information on what words are easiest to understand.
When in class we had been studying sound and the McGurk effect which explains how we comprehend sound along with visual cues. We wanted to know what types of words are easiest to understand when lip reading when there are only visual cues and no sound.
We came up with a word list and tested many people to find out what words can be understood in context and out of context. This will help us in the future to communicate in different ways.
