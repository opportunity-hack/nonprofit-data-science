This project measures how anxiety and depression have been affected by the pandemic, relative to before the pandemic began. This project interested me because it went well with current times and gave me an understanding of the underlying effects of the pandemic, other than the clear health risks. The experiment pointed out that many students are showing increased levels of anxiety and depression, especially among the female demographic. This project is important because it will shed light on the growing issue that is mental health and may point out some longer-lasting effects that the pandemic has caused.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
