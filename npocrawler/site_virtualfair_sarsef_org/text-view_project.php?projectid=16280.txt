As freshwater sources around the world continue to decrease because of population growth, distilled drinkable water will become more valuable. The purpose of this study was to properly desalinate and distill saltwater with solar energy, focusing the rays of the sun through magnifying lenses. It was found that by using a Fresnel lens, the saltwater contained in a black stainless steel water bottle was able to boil, enabling 3 mL of distilled water to be produced from this process. These results suggest that solar desalination could be a legitimate solution to the continual shrinkage of the sources of freshwater in the world.
This project has been cleared by SRC.


Comments

Excellent research on desalination and the different techniques for desalinating water.
Science projects that deal with water conservation and use are very important projects.  Well done project.
Great job
