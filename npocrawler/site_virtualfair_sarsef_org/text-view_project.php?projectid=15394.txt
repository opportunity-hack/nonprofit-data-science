This project explores the effects of the sun on different types of paper. This project was chosen because the students in our class showed an interest in why the bulletin boards faded in our classroom leaving behind various prints. Our conclusion was that the color of ink over the paper changed the intensity of the print left behind. This project helped our students to begin exploring the effects of sun light on various materials. Keywords: sun, print, fade
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Teamwork is important. You shared ideas and learned from each other. i liked the colors you chose, light and dark. The different shapes was creative too.
Love the drawings by the kids and their idea to try other kinds of paper.
I liked it:) It was very interesting!
