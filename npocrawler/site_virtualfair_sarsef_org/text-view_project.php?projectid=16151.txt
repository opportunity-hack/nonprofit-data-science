Multi Bar 3.0

My invention is a chocolate bar that has three flavors all in one. The Multi Bar 3.0 solves the problem of having to choose one flavor of chocolate. Instead, you can get the Multi Bar 3.0 with milk, white, and dark chocolate all in one bar. I chose this project because my mom always says I can only have on chocolate when I ask for one and it is really hard for me to decide what flavor to pick. This solves the problem of having to decide. I can have all three.
