This project showed if chemicals that are sprayed into our fruits really help make them last longer. Since that is what many people claim it does.

1. My project is about seeing whether if fruits that are sprayed with chemicals are able to outlast fruits that haven't been sprayed with chemicals.
2. I chose this project because I was interested on seeing if the chemicals are really necessary for these fruits to have a longer shelf life. But what also made me curious was how people claim that the preservatives actually make the fruits last longer.
3. My conclusion was that the organic fruit had outlasted the non organic fruits, and I got this result by getting 3 different types of fruits (bananas, grapes, and apples), labeling the fruits, and leaving them there on the kitchen counter. The non-organic apples had small brown spots and some bruises, while the organic ones were in top condition. The non-organic bananas were completely brown while the organic ones still had a bit of yellow on them. But finally the organic grapes had been starting to turn into raisins, since they were dry and shriveling up. The organic ones had begun but they were more plump.
4. This project is important because we are able to see if it is really necessary to add those chemicals in our fruit. Especially when pesticides are known to have some side effects.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
