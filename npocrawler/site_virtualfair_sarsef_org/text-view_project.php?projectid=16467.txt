1/2 cup vinegar had either 1 Tbsp. or three Tbsp. baking soda added to it via a balloon that capped the bottles of vinegar. CO2 filled the balloons from the reactions. Both sets of balloons with differing amounts of baking soda blew up to the same size . Vinegar amount was increased to 1 cup which resulted in more CO2 filling the balloon with only one Tbsp. of baking soda.
