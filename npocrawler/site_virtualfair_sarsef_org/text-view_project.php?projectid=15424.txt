Taking Control: How My Food and Exercise Decisions Impact My Blood Glucose Levels
Health and Wellness

Sophie Roth Gordon
Grade:
7

Teacher:
Derek Roth Gordon

My project explores how healthy food decisions based on the Glycemic Index, and choices about exercise and wellness, impact my blood glucose levels. I chose this project because I was diagnosed with prediabetes earlier this year, and I wanted to really understand how my decisions were impacting my health (and I wanted to make sure I didn't develop full Type-2 Diabetes.) My results showed that nutrition choices based on Glycemic Index had some correlation to how high my blood sugar levels rose after eating those foods, but not as much as I thought it would. I did find high carbohydrate foods spiked my blood sugar more than protein-based foods like meats and eggs. More significantly, I found that increasing my exercise after eating had a really big effect on my glucose levels. This project was very important for me because it allowed me to better understand my body, and how the decisions I make every day affect this potentially chronic disease. Hopefully I will inspire other young people with diabetes to do research like this on themselves do they can take control of their health too.

Very cool! Congratulations, Sophie, on a great project. David wanted you to k ow heâ€™s also working on a diabetes project. Heâ€™s helping a doctor write an article about his research!â€”Abby and David
So interesting Sophie! I was most surprised by orange juice which seems like sugar water. I admire that you tackled such a personal issue and learned so much about how your body works! Aunt Rachel (OH
