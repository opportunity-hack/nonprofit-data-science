1. My project is about freezing different materials in ice balloons to see how they break when dropped from a height of 6 ft. 2.  I created this experiment to see if I could strengthen ice by adding different materials. #. The result is I can strengthen ice because the toilet paper ice balloon broke the least. 4. My project is important because it helped me learn about the different states of matter and creating new materials. Key words: ice balloons, ice wood, pykrete, toilet paper,
This project has been cleared by SRC.

These look like works of art in glass! You also have very nice handwriting!! Good job!
I never knew that you could strengthen ice like this. Great idea!
I like how you wrote it.
I think you did a really good job I would have never thought of that
