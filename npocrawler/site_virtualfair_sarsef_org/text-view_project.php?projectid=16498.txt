Beat the Heat - Will Sound Waves Put Out a Fire?

I am trying to put a fire out with sound waves.  I wanted to start a fire with water, and put it out with something else.  I love music.  We were not successful.   I think I could change our project and be successful.  My project could create a new fire extinguisher.

Even if the fire wasn't put out, the music will never be extinguished! Loved your project!
What a clever idea - never seen anything like it before! Great question to answer - don't give up on it.
I think that is a grate projectðŸ˜Š
