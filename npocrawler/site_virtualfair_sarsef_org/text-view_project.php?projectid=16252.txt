How Much Water Passes Through Different Cement Mixes?

I did this experiment because I am interested in how water is absorbed into the earth. Everyday people drive on the road. In other places it rains a lot but not in Tucson. And when it rains a lot in Tucson, the streets are full of water. It would be nice if the roads could soak up the water. If the water absorbs it it will go into the ground. In the concrete that they use for roads, there are many rocks. That's one of the reasons that water doesn't seep through the roads. This project can help the roads.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

If I was a judge I’d give bonus point for the cat!
