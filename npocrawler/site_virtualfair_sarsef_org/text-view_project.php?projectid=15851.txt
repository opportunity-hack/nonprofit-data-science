I have always loved plants, especially flowers! So, I figured it would be a good idea to learn
the best way to start plant seeds out since ive had trouble before. When you think about planting
something, your first thought is putting a seed into dirt or soil, watering it, get it some sunlight and
hope it grows. Soil is great and has a lot of nutrients that help a plant grow and what it doesn’t get
from the soil, it gets from water and the sunlight. But what if sometimes all a seed needs is water
and sunlight? Well, it is possible and it’s a technique called hydroponics. I decided to try and test
and compare the two types of ways and see which would do best! From once the roots open up so
we can see them and everything after. Every plant and environment is different and might not work
for everything, but I tried using sunflower seeds in both soil and water and started tracking them
once I saw the shell of the seed open.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
