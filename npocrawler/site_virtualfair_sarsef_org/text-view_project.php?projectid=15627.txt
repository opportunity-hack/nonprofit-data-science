5-HW007
Bacteria Lurking in Your Food
Health and Wellness

Isabella Uzomba
Grade:
5

Teacher:
Jiaxin Dong

My Project is about how much bacteria is on food and which one has the most. I chose this project sickness and disease are a big part of life now and food contributes to that. My results were that veggies/spinach has the most amount of bacteria, bread had the least. My project is important because if someone saw my project they would know that maybe they should clean veggies more or that bread is saver than other foods and that bananas actually have a high amount of bacteria.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Your presentation was great!  And you totally convinced me to pay more attention to washing my fruit and veggies!!  Good job!
