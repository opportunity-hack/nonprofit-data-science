My project is on how rainbows are rainbows made. I chose this project because I chose this project because I wanted to know how rainbows are made in the sky. The suns white light is separated into the colors of the rainbow using a prism. My project is important because people will know how rainbows are made.

This is a really great investigation conducted on rainbows, I loved it - Venkata Manikonda
