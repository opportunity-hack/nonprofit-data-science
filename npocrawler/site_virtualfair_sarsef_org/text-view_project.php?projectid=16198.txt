HS-EL007
How Triangle Shape Affects Bridge Performance
Electrical and Mechanical Engineering

Owen Ashbeck
Grade:
HS

Teacher:
Elyse Wexler

This project is about how triangle shape affects how much weight a bridge can hold.
I chose this project because I wanted to know if the shape of the triangle mattered.
I came to the conclusion that I had changed a control variable on accident and it messed up my experiment.
My project is important because people sometimes don't think about what happens when they mess with the control variables and this is an example of that.
This project has been cleared by SRC.


Comments

It was excellent that you noted flaws in the design of your bridge(s) and interated the design with improvements. That's what we do in Design Eng. Design, analysis and test and sometimes repeat.
its good
I really like it
it looks like the person worked really hard.
