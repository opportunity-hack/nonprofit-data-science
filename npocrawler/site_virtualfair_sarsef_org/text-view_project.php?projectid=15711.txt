What the Sludge!
Chemical Science

Rolando Bayarcal

I am figuring out which chemical solution can break down grease the fastest. During this process I have learned many things such as effective solutions to clearing out a drain. For this project I am focusing on sink drains because families sink drains may be clogged and they don’t know how to fix it. Even including my own family which is the main purpose behind this project.

        This can help others because this chemical solution can be very useful to make a sink drain flow more smoothly. The problem I am trying to solve is an effective way to clean drains.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
