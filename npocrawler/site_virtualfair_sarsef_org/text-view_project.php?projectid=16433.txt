Germs and Where They Hide...

Since this Pandemic has started, I've been getting more and more interested in germs and safety. Covid-19 is not going away, and I am very curious on where germs go and the hotspots for them. There are several reasons I am researching about this topic. I am not in school yet but when I go into hybrid learning, I would like to know how germs spread and what are some precautions to avoid them.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
