Dogs: Tricks or Treats?

This project is about testing dogs, their senses of smell/taste, and animal behavior.  I chose this project because I like dogs and thought it'd be fun.  The dog picked stinky chicken treats the most and can conclude that strong smelling things appeal to dogs.  This project is important because better treats/food can be made and dogs' senses can be used in ways like: search/rescue, police work, and illness detection.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
