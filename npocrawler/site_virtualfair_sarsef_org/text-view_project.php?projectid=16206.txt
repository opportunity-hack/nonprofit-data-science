I wanted to learn why our arms seem to float up after we press them hard against a door jam. Based On my research, I predict that the more narrow door jam will cause arms to float up higher than the more extended door jam because of Kohnstamm effect. The reason why I did this is that many people wouldn't have even researched this and now I can provide you with the information.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
