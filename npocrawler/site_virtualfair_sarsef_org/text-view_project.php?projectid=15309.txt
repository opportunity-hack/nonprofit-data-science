In our ocean there are 8.3 million microplastics per cubic meter that are being consumed by many marine creatures including the endangered species of sea turtles. Therefore, this research aimed to find a way to eliminate microplastics from our oceans by investigating the efficacy of Pestalotiopsis microspora fungi vs Ictalurus furcatus fish gut biome on the biodegradation of polystyrene microplastics.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
