1. My project is about geodes and whether it's possible to tell what the inside will look like based on the outside appearance.
2. I chose this project because I thought it would be fun and geology is very interesting to me.
3. I found that just because the geode is large doesn’t mean that its crystals will be big. My largest geode still had a lot of small crystals similar to my smallest geode. The color of the crystal was the same no matter what color the outside was. In conclusion, the outside appearance of a geode will  not necessarily determine what the inside will look  like.
4. My project is important because it studies geology and the affect the environment has on the formation of geodes."
This project has been cleared by SRC.

I'm interested in geology too. Your geodes are beautiful.
This is crazy! Geodes seem like a very hard concept to master but you did this really well! Great Job!
How much fun it must have been to create an experiment around geodes.  Excellent work!
Wow this is great! I would have thought a bigger geode would have larger crystals. Very interesting!
Excellent work! Beautiful geodes!
