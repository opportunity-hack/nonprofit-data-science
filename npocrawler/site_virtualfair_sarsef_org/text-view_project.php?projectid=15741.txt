I choose this problem because I do the Pinewood Derby for Cub Scouts and I want to win first
place. So the problem is that how do I win first place. Are there variables I can change to help my
car go faster?
I am in Cub Scouts and I am in the Bears Den for 3rd graders and I have done the Pinewood
Derby since Tigers (1st grade). The Pinewood Derby is where we build a car out of a block of
wood and race down a hill indoors! My Den has the most people so I need to build a fast car.
The Pinewood Derby is super cool and you get to keep your cars you made!
This project has been cleared by SRC.
