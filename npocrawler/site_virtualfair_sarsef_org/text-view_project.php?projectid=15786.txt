My project is about how different genres of music affect someone's memory retention. I chose this project because as someone who both forgets things easily and has loved music ever since I was a kid I thought it would be interesting to look into. My overall result was that classical music shows the greatest result. My project is important because when studying, students often take to listening to music to help focus. Knowing what kind of music to listen to so as to benefit one's study efforts will improve test scores all around.
This project has been cleared by SRC.


Comments

Interesting topic and important conclusion.  If students realize this, do you think they'll chose classical music?  I hope so. . .but that's a whole other question.  Good job.
