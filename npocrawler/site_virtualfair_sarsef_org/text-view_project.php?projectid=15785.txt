Landfills produce a large amount of greenhouse gasses which are contributing to the globl warming crisis. Studies show that incinerating trash produces less greenhouse gasses than landfills so, I created a truck that incinerates trash which also reduces the waste in landfills. This is very important because global warming is a crisis and our landfills are also filling up.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

I wonder if you could use the thermal energy from the incinerator truck for anything else? Could it produce electricity? Very interesting, unique idea!
