Bounce, the Pressure Is On!

"We wanted to find out if the tennis balls that we played tennis with before COVID-19, bounced less than new ones. We wanted to see if the tennis balls lose pressure after being stored in non-pressurized containers after about a year. The amount of bounce that a tennis ball has, directly affects a tennis player’s game. We tested this by dropping the balls from a set height and recording the bounce height of balls that had been stored for about a year and compared them to new balls fresh out of pressurized containers. 
"
This project has been cleared by SRC.
