Grade:

Teacher:
Mandi Cordell

My project is determining if I can make a chicken coop Eco-friendly. I am building my chicken coop Eco-friendly with recycled, reused, and organic materials so that I don’t waste environmental resources.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Your design from reused materials is impressive!
Great engineering!
I liked the way you kept a journal with drawings and data.  Are you charting egg output?  What factors influence egg output?
