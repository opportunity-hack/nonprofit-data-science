Colorful Chemistry Creations: Sun Prints with Color and Light
Chemical Sciences

Pamela Buchanan Class
Grade:
4

Teacher:
Pamela Buchanan

We live in the land of the sun, so as a class we decided to experiment with light and color to make sun prints.  Students will determine how different colors of light affect the brightness of a sun print image. Not only was this fun, but we had some beautiful pictures.  We also discovered warm and cool colors.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
