Does a Cat's Age Affect Its Reaction to Catnip?

Lindsay Wong

This project was designed to test whether or not the age of a cat affects their reaction to catnip.  This project was selected due to a love for cats and a desire to learn more about their behavior and how to best care for them. Although I expected older cats to have a bigger change in their behavior after catnip, my results indicated the opposite.  Younger cats exhibited more change in their behavior. This project is important to better understand cats and to be aware of common reactions to a frequently used cat treat in order to care for cats as best we can.

Great job, what a fun experiment. For next year look up "ethograms", they are used in animal behavior studies.
I hope the cats get adopted, they are so cute!
I really liked how you made a numeric scale to translate your behavior observations into numeric data. Makes it far easier to draw conclusions from numeric scores than written observations
This is such a good idea. I now know this for my cat, because they have different ages of catnip, so now I know
