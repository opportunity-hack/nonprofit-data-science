Solar Cooking - Showing its True Colors

In this experiment, I will be testing exterior color to figure out how it affects the temperature within a solar oven. The purpose of this experiment is to test whether exterior color affects temperature. I became interested in this experiment when I understood the meaning of albedo and wanted to apply that knowledge in different scenarios. The information gained through this experiment will help figure out what is the best color for cooking foods that requires high temperatures.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
