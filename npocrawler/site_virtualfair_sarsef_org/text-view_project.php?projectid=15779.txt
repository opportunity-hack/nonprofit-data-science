HS-AS009
The Effect of Human Interactions In Relation to Dog (Canis lupus familiaris) Behavior Observed
Animal Science

Grade:
HS

Teacher:
Elyse Wexler

This project focuses on how our interactions with dogs affect how they behave. I chose studying dog behavior because I'm interested in learning more about why they behave in the way they do at times. I found that one type of human interaction typically results in one type of dog behavior. This is important to understanding how and why dogs behave the way they do, which is important for dog owners and trainers.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
