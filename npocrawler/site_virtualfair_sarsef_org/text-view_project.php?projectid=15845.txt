My project is about testing different types of water to see why people prefer one type over the other. I took samples from different types of water sources and tested them with a water test kit. Then I had people try each type of water. They wrote down which they liked the best and I tried to figure out from the test kit why that might be.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
