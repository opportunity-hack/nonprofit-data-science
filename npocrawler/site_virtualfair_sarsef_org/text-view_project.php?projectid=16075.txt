Push Pile Broom

I made this push broom because i sweep a lot in a kitchen and when i use a push broom it doesn't make a very small pile to clean up. This broom helps me a lot because it can make a smaller pile than other push brooms and still cleans up a big amount of room.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
