Say Bye to Chirps
Animal Science

My project is about seeing if the genre of music made cricket chirps less frequent. I chose this project because my aunt has a pet that eats live crickets and she says that the chirps are really annoying, so I wanted to see if playing different music would help with that. My conclusion was that there was really not much difference between the different genres. It is important because it will help anyone with pets that eat live crickets to help them chirp less frequently.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
