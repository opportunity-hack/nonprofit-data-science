Have you ever been drinking a slushie and it gets stuck in the bottom of the cup.I have the solution to this problem. The Mixer Straw. I have invented a straw that you can turn and stir your slushie while you are drinking it to prevent it from clogging up your straw or getting the slushie all stuck in the bottom of the cup. This straw is also reusable so it helps the Earth. This straw is important because it saves the Earth and it also helps you enjoy your slushie much more.
