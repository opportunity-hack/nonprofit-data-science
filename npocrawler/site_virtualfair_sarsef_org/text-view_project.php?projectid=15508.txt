1. My project is on the affect radiation has on different colors of paper.
2. I chose this project because I am interested in learning about the different forms of energy and how they affect different objects and cycle
3. My hypothesis was supported because the Blue construction paper absorbed the most heat while the yellow construction paper absorbed the least amount of heat.
4. My project is important because learning about the different forms of energy can help us to understand how to use them to our advantage in better helping the Earth.
This project has been cleared by SRC.


Comments

Radiant energy is a variable not everybody thinks about, and your graph is really nice color coded!
