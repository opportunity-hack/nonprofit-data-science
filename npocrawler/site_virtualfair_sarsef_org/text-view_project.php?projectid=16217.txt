A mask is needed for protection and safety from COVID-19, but some masks are very thin and do not protect that much; however, masks that do fully protect are extremely expensive. This led to the idea to make a mask that was fully protected and made out of things that were not expensive and around the house. The 10th prototype proved to be the best one for easy breathing while collecting all the spit when one exhaled, so the virus in the spit did not travel out of the mask and also keeping other's spit from coming past the filter. The mask is important because everyone should be able to afford a fully protective mask to keep themselves and others safe.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
