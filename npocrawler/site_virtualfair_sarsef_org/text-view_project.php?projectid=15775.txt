Teacher:
Elyse Wexler

This investigation studied the effects of online school on the hours of sleep and level of stress in students aged 14-17. This project was chosen because it was extremely applicable to the current increase of online school usage during the Covid-19 pandemic. Overall, the data showed that online students had higher stress levels and less sleep than in-person students. The project is important because it could be used to inform administrators and teachers on how they can better help students in online learning to create healthier environments and increase overall well being.
