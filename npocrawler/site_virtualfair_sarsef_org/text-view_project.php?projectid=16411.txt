Does Political Affiliation Affect Taste in Music?
Behavioral and Social Science

Joaquin Islas
Grade:
8

Teacher:
David Ficke

The project is about the political connection to music. I chose this project because it seemed interesting to research. That political affiliation does hold some connection to music, but not in a landslide of numbers. This is important because it shows how we may get political ideas.
This project has been cleared by SRC.


Comments

Interesting topic, with results that surprised me.  Knowing the age range of respondents might further inform their preferences, politically and musically.  Good job.  Keep it up.
