Grade:
7

Teacher:
Adam Norzagaray

Hello! Am Julie Schrock, I am for Borman K8 and am a 7th grader. I always been into plants ever
since my Since teacher Mr. Ray taught me how to grow them.
Ever since I notice that strawberries come in a packet with different other kinds like old,
new, and regular. I thought that what happens if the DNA in the strawberries are different then
the other kinds. Let's dive in and see what leads us to Extracting DNA from Strawberries.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
