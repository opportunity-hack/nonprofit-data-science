Salinity at Agua Caliente Park

1. My project is about the water quality of Agua Caliente Park Pond 1 and its impact on native Gila topminnow & Gila chub.
2. Earlier this year, I was taking water samples at Agua Caliente Park for fun and noticed white stuff on the shore of the ponds and I wondered what it could be.
3. pH and dissolved oxygen could become a problem at Agua Caliente Park Pond 1 if Pima County Parks and Recreation doesn’t intervene with the pond water quality. My hypothesis was correct in that the decrease in water quality will affect native fish. My hypothesis was incorrect in that salinity would be the problem. 
4. While these fish are rebounding from near-extinction, it is extremely important that the pH and DO are continually monitored and efforts to improve water quality are maintained. Monitoring water quality for habitability of these fish at rescue ponds like Agua Caliente Park will continue to be important for the recovery of these species.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
