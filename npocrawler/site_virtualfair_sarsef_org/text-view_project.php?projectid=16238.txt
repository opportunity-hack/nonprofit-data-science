My project is about which design of 5 airplanes is the fastest and travels the most distance. I chose this project because I was curious on why airplanes look the way they do. My result was that the “tailed plane” was the best design due to their wings and tail, giving lots of lift. My project is important because it explains the basic forces of flight.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
