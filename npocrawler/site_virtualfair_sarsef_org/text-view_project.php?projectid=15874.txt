Our project is about chargers and which charger charges iPhones the fastest. We chose this project because we wanted to do a science fair project that would help people. We have identified Anker chargers to be the fastest and and Apple chargers to be the second fastest. Our project is important because we don't want people to waste their money buying bad chargers and we also don't want people to have to wait longer for their phones to charge.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

What about cost?  Was your Anker the most expensive because is performed the best?
Also, you mentioned in hypothesis about cable size having something to do with how fast the phone charged.  What did you find out about cable size?  Nice clean project.  Graphs were easy to interpret.
