Mrs. Wellman

Which of the two paper towel brands is stronger bounty or brawny? I chose this so we can know which one is the better option when at the store. Bounty was stronger in every phase of the experiment. This was an important project because now we know which paper towel we can rely on more.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
