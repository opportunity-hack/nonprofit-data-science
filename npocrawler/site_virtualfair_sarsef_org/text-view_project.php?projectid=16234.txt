Animal intelligence: How smart is Jasper?
Animal and Plant Sciences

Grade:

Teacher:
Mrs. Gibson

This project considers animal intelligence more broadly, and then focuses on our family dog. Intelligent animals can solve problems and are patient. A set of tests involving a dog treat were used to evaluate his problem solving abilities and patience.It’s about doing science to learn about how smart my dog Jasper is. I also wanted to learn about what makes animals smart.I choose this project because I like animals and I want to be an animal doctor when I grow up.I learned that Jasper is smart, but in a different way than I thought. Jasper could follow rules to get a treat under a cup. This project is important because animals can be smart and can help people.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

You are a great dog owner and learned about animal behavior from Jasper.  Good work!
I really like your drawing of Jasper. He is lucky to have you!
