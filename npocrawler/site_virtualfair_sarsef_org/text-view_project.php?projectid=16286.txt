This science experiment was performed to determine the effects of commonly consumed sugary drinks on a person's teeth.   I selected five different liquids that we normally drink every day (at my house), calculated the grams of sugar in each drink, and then immersed one (of my baby teeth) tooth into each liquid for a period of five weeks.  I examined, took notes, and photographed each tooth every week.  After five weeks, I noted the damage to each tooth.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
