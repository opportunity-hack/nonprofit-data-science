Our project is about how to prevent rotting fruit and growing bacteria. We chose this project because if some people can't afford a refrigerator, we wanted to find a way so that their food is fresh longer. Our conclusion was that fruit and vegetable wash kept the grapes fresh the longest out of tap water, lemon juice, fruit and vegetable wash, H202, and Dawn dish soap. It's good to know what solution will work for washing grapes because rotting food and microbes aren't good for you, and it's bad for the earth because it increases food waste.
This project has been cleared by SRC.


Comments

good work with scientific method!
Very well thought out project, good discussion of procedure and results. Good photos especially the agar dishes showing the bacterial growth which emphasize your results.
Outstanding that you had two separate ways to determine the effectiveness of the various solutions - both petri dish and fruit observation. Way to be thorough with your data collection
Wow what an amazing project, I never would have thought of doing that if I didn't have a refrigerator!
