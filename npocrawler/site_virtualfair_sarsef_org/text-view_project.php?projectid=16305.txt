My project studied the braying behavior of donkeys. I chose this project because I run with burros and I help out at the donkey rescue. My conclusions were female donkeys bray more frequently but males bray longer. It was important because it studies the communication behavior of donkeys.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

i love your project! it tells so much about donkeys and their braying behavior. great job!
I love burros!  I wonder the purpose for the differences; males braying longer and females braying more?  Nice project!
Great, unique topic, I've never seen this one before. Way to be original.
Great job with adding statistical analysis to your results. Helped solidify your conclusions.
Good use of helpers and "resident expert" to identify and record the braying. Doing science doesn't mean you have to do it all by yourself.
