I was able to make an actually good cardboard vr headset that will actually look cool and feel really good.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Wow! I like how you came up with a low-cost solution to getting a VR Headset. Cardboard and Legos certainly aren't as much as a
an Oculus Quest. I'm glad you found something that was more comfortable. Great job.
