The Probability of Getting a Cornhole
Physics, Astronomy, and Mathematics

Allyson Tate
Grade:
HS

Teacher:
Elaine MacKenzie

My project was about finding the probability of getting a Cornhole immediately after your opponent.  I chose this project because I love playing Cornhole with friends and family and love mathematics.  My conclusion was a double Cornhole happens 3.1% of the time.  This was important because I learned how to apply probability and statistics to real-world problems.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
