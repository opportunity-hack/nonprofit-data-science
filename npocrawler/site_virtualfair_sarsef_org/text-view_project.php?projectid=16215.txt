I wanted to know if saguaros are affected by climate change. I hypothesized that the death rate of saguaros would be higher with climate change. I collected data on the death rate of saguaros at Tumamoc Hill. There has been an increase in the death rate of saguaros there since 2012, with extreme heat and cold events.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
