My project was focused on making a table that can be used almost anywhere that was made out of recycled materials. I choose this project because I was wanting to have a small table that I could use and I also did not want to have to buy something new. In the end my table turned out as good as I hoped for and is very helpful. This project is important because finding new ways to overcome challenges even as simple as finding a comfortable place to work is how we can eventually make the world a better place.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
