Jennifer DeBenedetti

How can we thwart a LEGO EV3 ultrasonic sensor? An initial interest in echolocation led students to research ultrasonic waves.  They decided to study these waves by programming a LEGO EV3 ultrasonic sensor.  Eventually they wondered if they could block this ultrasonic signal as a means of defense, which led to further research and design of their own bubble makers.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
