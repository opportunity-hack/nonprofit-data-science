Science of Slime: How Does My Slime Change As I Change the Recipe?

I like to make slime. I have noticed that the slime feels different when I add different amounts of activator (borax and water) to glue. I found that adding more activator made the slime flow slower, but it still stretched just as far (as far as we could measure). I liked learning about the chemistry of slime, and the results of this project will help me make better slimes in the future.
