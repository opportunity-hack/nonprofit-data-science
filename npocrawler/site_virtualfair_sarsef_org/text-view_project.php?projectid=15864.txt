What is your project about?
My project is about creating an alternative for a cone when a dog gets stitches 



Why did you choose this project?
I chose this project, because my dog has very sensitive skin and a cone was always really inconvenient for her, because it was so bulky and she is so little.


What was your result/overall conclusion?
I made 2 bandages out of 2 different types of fabric that would wrap around the dogs abdomen.


Why is your project important?
My project is important because a lot of people get their dogs fixed and its important that it is cared and wrapped properly, and the bandage is simple and the only wrapping you need.
This project has been cleared by SRC.


Comments

You have done a nice job of appreciating the constraints and promises of coming up with a new tool or invention.
Great project. I loved your motivation for doing the project
This took a lot of thought and skills to create.  It was very nice of your dog to participate.
