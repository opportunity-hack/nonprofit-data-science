Deb Goepfrich

We did a class project about sound and pitch.  We chose this project because we have been learning about sound and vibrations in class.  We learned that you can change objects in different ways to make vibrations (sound waves) go faster or slower, which makes the pitch go up or down.  This project is important because it helped us learn how and why sounds change.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
