pH vs. Plastic

My project was testing the effect of common types of plastic pollutants on the pH of ocean water. I knew I wanted to do a project on the environment and chose this specific topic because I had some knowledge on it, and thought it would be an interesting way to gain new knowledge. I found after completing the tests that in the window of time that was tested, that none of the types of plastic had an effect on the pH of the ocean water. I believe that my project is an example of how we could possibly gain more knowledge about the environmental issues we're facing and is a step in the right direction.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
