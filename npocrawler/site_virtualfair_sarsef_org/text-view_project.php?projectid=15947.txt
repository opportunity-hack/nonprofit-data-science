My science fair project is about healthy grains. I tested maize, wheat, and rice to determine the amount of sugar and protein they each had. 

I chose this because I was interested in foods from around the world and their level of nutrition.

 I decided that a good first step would be to test the nutritional value of different grains. I did some research on the different types of grain and chose three to experiment on. I ended up with maize, wheat, and rice. I tested each grain for protein three times and each for sugar three times. 

The conclusion I came to was that wheat is the healthiest grain of the three analyzed. Wheat has the best balance of sugar and protein with a traceable amount of sugar and a moderate to low amount of protein. 

This is important because it’s good to know the health factors in what you are eating. If someone is trying to watch what kinds of food they eat, this is information is good to know.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
