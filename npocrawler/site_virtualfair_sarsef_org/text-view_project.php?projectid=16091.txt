After getting a new puppy and not knowing how much they like to chew on everything, and yes we bought her plenty of chew toys! Nothing seemed to keep her entertained while I would hold her except my fingers. I don’t know about you but a puppy bite does not feel good, plus we didn’t want her to get into the habit of biting everyone’s fingers. That’s why I came up with the Chewy Chain! It’s equipped with all the essentials that my puppy found entertaining, a squeaky shoe, ribbon a bone and ball all made out of a paracord. It’s a comfortable necklace that I wear while hold my puppy and she stays entertained with it  while I pet and cuddle with her.
