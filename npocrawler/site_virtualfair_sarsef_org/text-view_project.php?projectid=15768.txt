My project is about comparing the two most popular ways to clean your toothbrush and putting them up to the test to find out which one is the most effective. I choose this project because due to the pandemic I have been more aware about the things around me and I thought what better place to start then the thing that I use everyday to clean my mouth. The result of my project was that running your toothbrush under hot for 15 minutes sanitised it better. My project is important because it shows us that not all methods work as well to disinfect some have better result while others don't.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
