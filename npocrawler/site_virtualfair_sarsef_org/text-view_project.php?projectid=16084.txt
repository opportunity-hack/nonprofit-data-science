Our project is about building a sustainable city on the moon. We chose this project because it sounded interesting and fun, to use what we already know about the moon to build a image of what a lunar city would look like. Our project was important to show what a Lunar City design would look like if Earth gets overpopulated or hazardous. Keywords: lava tubes, regolith, water ice, mining, radiation, space.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
