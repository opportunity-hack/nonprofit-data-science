Which Candles Burn Faster?

Grade:

My project is about what candle type burns the fastest. The reason I chose this project is because I know that people think about candles size when they think of which candle will last the longest, so that's why I wanted to figure out which candle type burned the fastest. The result was that the first to burn out was the Gel then Paraffin, Beeswax, and lastly Soy. It's important because then people will save some money when buying candles.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
