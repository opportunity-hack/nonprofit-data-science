What is your project about?
My project is about making a backpack that is comfortable and will not cause long term back problems.



Why did you choose this project?
I chose this for my project because I always see kids at school that are complaining about back pain from their backpacks. Another reason why I chose the Multi-pack for my project is because not only will the multi- pack make backpacks more comfortable but also is meant for younger children who have trouble with keeping their backpack on, this will help them because there is a vest attached to the backpack which will prevent children from removing their backpack or having it on one shoulder.


What was your result/overall conclusion?
My design was successful in making sure that both straps were on my shoulder at all times, and the weight was distributed across my body because my vest was zipped. 

Why is your project important?
This project was important because it can help evolve the backpack, and make sure there are no more long term back problems caused by backpacks in the future.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
