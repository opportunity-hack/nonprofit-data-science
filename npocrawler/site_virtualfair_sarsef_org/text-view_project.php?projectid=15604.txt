My project is about how the length, thickness, and tension of a violin string affect the frequency. I chose this project because I'm a musician, and seeing the vocal cords vibrate. My results were that the shorter and thinner the strong, the higher the pitch. My project is important because it teaches me how violin generates notes, and why boys' voice gets lower in high school.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Great job! I love how you compared the violin strings to the human voice! :)
