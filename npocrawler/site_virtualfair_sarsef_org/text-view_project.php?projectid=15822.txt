Our project is about creating a sustainable city on the Moon using two of the Moon's resources. We were part of the Future City annual engineering challenge this year. It is possible to create a city that is able to sustain itself using at least three resources on the Moon. We understood that we had to be a bit smarter about our city design since the circumstances and environment up there on the Moon are so different. This project is important since we may help fix the problems on Earth in some ways, like clean energy with Helium 3.  Another important part of our project is that people will want to explore things on other planets. (helium 3, regolith, waste management, water, solar, energy, health, safety, artificial intelligence, Moon, mining)
This project has been cleared by SRC.


Comments

Excellent research and planning.  Good luck with your presentation for the Future City Engineering Challenge.  What about the atmosphere inside your city?  How will oxygen and nitrogen be produced?
