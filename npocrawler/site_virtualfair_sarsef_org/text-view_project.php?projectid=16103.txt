We'll Crush That Bridge When We Get There

My science project was about bridge design and which type of design is the strongest. I chose this project because building and crushing a bridge sounded like a fun idea. My result ended up being different than what my research said it should have been. My project is important because it can help with knowing what kind of bridges are stronger and safest.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
