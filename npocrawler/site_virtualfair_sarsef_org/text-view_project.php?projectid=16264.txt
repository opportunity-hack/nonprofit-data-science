Ramped Up & Dog Tired

There are many dog ramps you can buy at places like PetsMart. Many are very expensive and bulky to carry  around. They also don’t do anything but work as a ramp. So I designed a folding dog ramp that also can work as a  bed. This way you can make a bed and a ramp together to  save space and time. I have a new Corgi puppy. He’s almost a year now. He likes to jump up and down from things but the veterinarian said that jumping will be bad for his legs and hips.The dog ramp worked as planned. he ramp is light enough to carry easily and folds to store easily. This is important because small  dogs with short legs need ramps and older dogs plus dogs that shouldn’t be jumping need ramps as well. Animal surgery is expensive. My dog also does not like to get in and out of the car on his own. He was getting too heavy for us to pick up and we needed to find a solution.There are never enough new and innovative ways to design new things for pets that make life easier and  maybe even save some money.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
