This project is to understand if vision plays a role in taste.  I chose this project because it sounded fun and I didn't know if about it.  It was interesting to learn about sight and taste.  I learned that color does affect how someone tastes something.  I think this project is important because it shows how different senses are connected.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Great experiment on how color affects taste! I really enjoyed the detail that you put into here as it is creative! Most creative project I have seen! - Venkata Manikonda
You had a very detailed approach to this experiment. I did not know color might change how something tastes.
I might try this at home because I liked this experiment so much.
