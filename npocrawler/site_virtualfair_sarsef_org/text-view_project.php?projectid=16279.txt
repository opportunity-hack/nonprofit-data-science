The Native Way: Using Dead Fish As Fertilizer
Animal and Plant Science

Grade:

Teacher:
Thad Hardeman

Most Americans have heard the tale of the Native Americans planting fish with corn seeds to fertilize them. This experiment aimed to test this tale and to test the effectiveness of this fertilization method. Forty two basil seeds were used in this experiment. Six seeds were planted in six pots each; four control pots, one pot with an entire fish, and one pot with a fish head. This experiment compared the effects of using non edible fish parts to fertilize plants with using a whole fish to fertilize plants to test the claims that the Natives only used non edible fish parts instead of whole fish. It was found that fertilizing plants with whole fish worked the best and the fertilizing the plant with fish heads worked the second best, and that plants that were not fertilized with fish performed the worst.
