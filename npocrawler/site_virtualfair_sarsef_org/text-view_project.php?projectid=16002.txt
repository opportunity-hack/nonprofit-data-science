The project is about the internet controlling our lives taking up so much time, telling us what to do. I chose this project because it was interesting. I think the internet is very important because it is a part of our everyday life because it is entertaining. It was important because it helped me answer lots of questions that I had.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
