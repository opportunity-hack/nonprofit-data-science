My project focuses on sleep, specifically, it focuses on helping me go to sleep easier, by turning off my lights remotely.
I decided to choose this project because where I sleep is far from my light switch, and it wakes me up a bit when I have to climb down from my bed and walk over to the light switch to turn it off.
In my project I successfully created a device to turn off my lights from my bed.
My project is important because sleep is very important, both having bright lights and movement could make it harder to sleep, and my device turns off bright lights without the user needing to move very far.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
