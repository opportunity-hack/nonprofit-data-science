Behavioral and Social Sciences

Grade:

Teacher:
Mandi Cordell

The problem I have is that it is hard to learn online, My solution is to test whether Minecraft or a lesson on a written document is better. To do this, I will have half the class do my lesson on Minecraft and the other half do a lesson on docs. Afterwards, they will have to take a quiz to show what they learned.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
