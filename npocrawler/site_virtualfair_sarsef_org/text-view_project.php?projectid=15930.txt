My project is about decomposing SurviveWare's wipes. The company claims that the wipes decompose in 28 days and my project was about seeing if that was true. I chose this project because I wondered if these wipes we had actually decomposed in 28 days. In conclusion, the wipes did not fully decompose or get anywhere close to fully decomposing. It is important to know if their wipes are okay to dispose of in the ground when backpacking.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
