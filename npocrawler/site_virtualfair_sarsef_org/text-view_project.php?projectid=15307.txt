We intend to create the most sustainable diet possible and to investigate whether or not people would be willing to incorporate it into their lives if the food were to be made more accessible. We chose to study this because we are passionate about solving the climate crisis and agriculture is the largest contributor to global emissions. We are still analyzing our results. Understanding how humans will have to adapt their lifestyles to save the environment will be integral in solving this existential emergency.

I really liked the combination of data-driven parameters linked to the social science of personal behaviors.  Good work!
Great job on your project! It is super interesting to see what people are willing to do.  I would be very curious to see how different populations and age groups would respond as well.
