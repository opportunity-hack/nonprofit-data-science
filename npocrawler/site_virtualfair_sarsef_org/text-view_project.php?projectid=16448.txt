My project tested which soil would grow radishes the fastest and most efficiently. I chose to do this project because I love gardening and radishes. I found that vegetable soil will grow radishes the fastest and most efficiently. This project is important because it can be used as knowledge for other gardeners when they are growing radishes.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
