This project investigated the efficiencies of different mulch types in retaining water by analyzing volumetric soil moisture and saturated surface dry masses of each mulch tested. It found that wood chip mulches, specifically freshly cut wood chips, are more efficient in retaining water than rock mulches. This data is important since it aims to help conserve water in the desert, but is also applicable for local greenery projects. By conserving water, trees and plants in Tucson can be maintained with more economical and environmentally conscious methods.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
