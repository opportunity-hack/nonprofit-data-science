My project was about dying water to see if flowers would change into the color of the water. I chose this project because I wanted to see if flowers changed colors in colored water. My project showed that the color of the flowers changed to the color of the water. My project is important so someone can see how the water gets to the flower.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

This was such a creative idea!  I love your pictures and I can't wait to see what you do next year!
