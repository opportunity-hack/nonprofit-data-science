One of the major causes for the massive number of deaths since the 1990's has been obesity. This complicated disease rapidly spread throughout regions and states, threatening the lives of millions of Americans in the United States. "The prevalence of obesity was 40.0% among young adults aged 20 to 39 years, 44.8% among middle-aged adults aged 40 to 59 years, and 42.8% among adults aged 60 and older. " | CDC,2020, P.1|.With this said, "smart and healthy snacks" such as Almonds and healthy Chips are suggested as a plus for a healthy diet. By the use of the following methods, this project was conducted. The first technique consists of labeling cups and jars to their respective name and number of trial. Secondly, after the 2 types of foods were crushed into each cup and jar, their mass was diligently weighted. Subsequently, acetone was poured into each cup and jar at a time. Finally, the cups and jars were left outside in a well-ventilated area for the fats to evaporate. The results from the experiment showed that both Almonds and Kettle Cooked Chips are healthy enough for people to consume, because the amount of fats extracted from both foods did not leave a significant amount fats inside the cup. In fact, the mass difference before and after extraction in Almonds varied from 5.84 grams to 12.17 grams. Similarly, Kettle Cooked Chips mass difference from the before and after extraction, assorted from 1 gram to 6 grams at the maximum.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
