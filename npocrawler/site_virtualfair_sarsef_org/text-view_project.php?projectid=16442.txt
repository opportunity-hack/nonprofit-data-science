Being Green When you Clean
Chemical Sciences

Grade:

Teacher:
Mrs. Teena Clark

I explored the difference of chemical levels in heavy regular cleaning all purpose agents vs. more all natural, plant based cleaners. I tested the cleaning products with a water testing kit. I explored the affect these chemicals can have on the environment when they enter our water system and on humans (human body). I reviewed the common toxic chemicals in cleaners, cleaner and greener alternatives and then reviewed the impact they can have.I chose to do this project because my family and I care deeply about the environment and water safety. I want to continue to grow in my “green” choices and help others to do the same. My result or overall conclusion is that greener, more plant based, cleaners are better for the environment.And, through my research on chemicals I concluded that the toxic chemicals that are in everyday cleaners can have a devastating effect on the environment. It is important to review and choose greener products for the health of our planet! This project is important to show and explain how important our choices as humans are. It is important to demonstrate that with simple changes in our daily practices and purchases we can make big, important, and healthy changes in our environment.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
