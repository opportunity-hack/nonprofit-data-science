I was thinking about doing a project on saving water, I chose to see what type of soil compound conserves the most water. . I am going to use three kinds of dirt: sand, soil, and pumice, plus a bunch of
mixed dirt.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

I like how you dealt with the problem created by number 7 spilling.
Great project! You chose a real question that you had to answer and got great results. Very well done.
Well constructed experiment with many data points.  Great job!
