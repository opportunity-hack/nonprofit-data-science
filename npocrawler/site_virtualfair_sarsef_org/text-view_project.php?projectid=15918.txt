Texas ran out of electricity and they´re freezing cold
because they do not have power to warm up their
houses. We have a friend who wishes he could warm
up his clothes so his feet would be warm. I wanted to find the best way to warm up our clothes.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Creative idea!
Great project! My feet are often cold, so now I know what to do. Also, I look forward to seeing what you discover about making things cool in the summer. I like how you thought through your process.
