Our project gives a design of a future city on the Moon that keeps people healthy and safe. We are in the Future City class and this was our engineering challenge this year. Our conclusion is that people can live on the Moon if they learn how to use technology and Moon;s resources to stay healthy and safe. We learned we have to use water ice, solar energy, and regolith to live and build. Someday in the future we may be living on the Moon. Something bad could happen on our planet and we will need to live on the Moon or another planet. 
Keywords: regolith, solar power, water, robots, Digitron, healthy, safety, Moon.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
