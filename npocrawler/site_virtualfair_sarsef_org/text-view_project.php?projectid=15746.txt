My project was to test which slime recipe was the stretchiest.  I chose this project because I love playing with slimes. The ones I enjoy the most are really stretchy. I found that Elmer’s Magical Liquid created the stretchiest slime compared to the homemade recipes. I also found out that when you add less contact solution, it makes the slime less viscous which makes the slime stretchier. My project is important because it shows that testing ingredients and testing different amounts is good to get the best results.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
