Which Water Is Safer, Tap or  Bottled Water?
Earth and Environmental Science

Grade:

Melissa Joliat

My project is about the difference between tap and bottled water and which one is safer. I chose this project because I wanted to see the difference between tap and bottled water. My overall conclusion was that there is a difference but not a bad one. My project is important because you're able to see the contaminant levels of hardness, Chlorine, Copper, Iron, pH, and more. Also, you're able to know what to look out for in your water.
Keywords:  Contaminants, Water Safety
This project has been cleared by SRC.
