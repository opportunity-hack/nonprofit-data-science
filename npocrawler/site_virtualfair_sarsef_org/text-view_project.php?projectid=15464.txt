Help Spread the Smile Virus: 15 Minutes of Smiles Could Save 15% or More on Happiness!

"During the Coronavirus  Pandemic, the majority of the population is wearing a mask while out in public. We wondered if that meant it was necessary to smile since no one can see our mouths. However, we also wondered if smiling can still be contagious since our eyes change shape when we smile. Our results showed that smiling is still contagious while wearing a mask. This was an important experiment for quite a few reasons. First of all, it was a safe way to get out of the house during this pandemic. It was also a way to spread a bit of joy during these challenging time. Finally, it was important to try and improve the research that states on average men only smile 8 times a day. Let’s continue spreading the Smile Virus!
