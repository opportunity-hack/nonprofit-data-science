Filter Fantastic: What's in Your Mask?

Last spring, a virus started to go around the world. People started to wear masks to help protect other people. I started to make my own masks by hand-knitting them and wondered if filters would help make them better. I put a coffee filter, a paper towel, a big leaf from a house plant, and Halyard Surgical Filter into the mask. I had my dad wear the mask and blow air through it at a pinwheel. I filmed the pinwheel and counted the revolutions in slow motion. I did one at a time three times in a row with each filter and without the filter and without the mask. The pinwheel spun over 15 times without a mask,  1-4 times with a mask, and barely spun at all with any of the filters. These results show that wearing a mask is better than no mask at all and a filter is even better.
This project has been cleared by SRC.


Comments

Good job! I like that you noted additional useful testing to confirm what particles get through. How breathable were the various masks? Is restricting airflow the main way that masks work?
I admire how well you controlled this experiment by testing each filter within the same mask design!
I like how current and applicable this project was to our lives
