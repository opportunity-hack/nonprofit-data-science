Monica Valdez Class
Grade:
5

Teacher:
Monica Valdez

My students wanted to find out how fast germs can spread around the classroom. 
3rd Base students have been very interested in where germs are found, how they make us sick, and why they spread so easily. My students are very visual and hands-on learners; Projects like this keeps them engaged and they will retain information that they have learned.
The students learned that germs can spread quickly within the classroom environment through touch.
My students had a difficult time understanding the reason they could not attend school during the COVID-19 pandemic. This project showed them that even though we can't see germs they have a devastating affect by easily spreading within any environment.
This project has been cleared by SRC.


Comments

I like this project because it shows how germs spread so quickly.  I think your class has discovered that even though they can't see the germs they are present and they need to have good hygiene.
