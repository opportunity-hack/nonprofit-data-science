Are there more mammals closer to the Saguaro National Park West or further from it? It's important to see how humans and human buildings affect wild animals. We had the most mammal captures from the camera closest to the National Park and the furthest camera had the least captures. I learned that there are more animals near the national park than further from the national park.This project is important because we need to know how human buildings affect wild
animals
