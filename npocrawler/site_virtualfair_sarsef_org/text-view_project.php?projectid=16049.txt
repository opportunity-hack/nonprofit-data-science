Vaccination Survey

Our project is about vaccination rates in our city/community and how they are affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
We chose this project because we wanted to measure how vaccination rates would change as a result of a worldwide pandemic, as well as wanting to measure vaccination rates in a heavily affected state/city (Arizona/Tucson).
Our hypothesis was partially correct, with all participants of the survey responding that they vaccinated overall, but only some said that they would be willing to vaccinate for other diseases and a new coronavirus vaccine.
The purpose of this project was to gather information on people’s opinions of vaccination and how they’ve changed as an effect of a worldwide pandemic, which is important because it shows how people react to a new and potentially threatening situation that affects the entire world.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Nice job.  Lots more to be done on this topic, as vaccines have become available for COVID.  Keep it up.  I see a future with the CDC for you.
