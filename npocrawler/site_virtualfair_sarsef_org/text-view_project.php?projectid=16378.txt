How Do Masks Really Measure Up?
Health and Wellness

Grade:

Big Question: 
Which type of mask is the most safe while also not affecting the person who is wearing it?

Hypothesis:
• I think that the double fabric mask will be the best mask because it will block the most particles from
escaping but will be cooler than the N95, KN95 and the filtered mask!
This project has been cleared by SRC.
