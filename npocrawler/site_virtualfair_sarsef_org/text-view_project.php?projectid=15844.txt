Can a Robot Navigate a Maze?
Engineering, Robotics and Computer Sciences

Grade:

Teacher:
Ellen Rieger

We wanted to see if we could use block code to program a robot to navigate a maze by identifying color and symbols. We have always enjoyed building robots with our Dad and are starting to learn coding and wanted to combine the two. We found that the robot can be coded to navigate the maze, but the maze needs to fit within the robots limitations of its "sight" and turning radius. Being able to navigate a maze using color and symbols would mean the robot could be helpful for disabled people.
