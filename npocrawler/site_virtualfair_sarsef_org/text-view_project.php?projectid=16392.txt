My project is about a robot that can sweep floors.

I chose it because I was thinking of ideas for projects that could be useful and something that people would want, but also something that I could realistically put together.

The result was technically not a success, but there is a lot that could be learned from this project, which can be used to try again and make something that works.

This project on a floor sweeping robot is important because it could be a technology that people will end up wanting and using. The robotics industry is not very developed right now, but it will arise in the future, which is why this project is important or just necessary.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
