This experiment was designed to determine which type of car crash generates the highest force. The experiment included testing three types of crashes; a fixed wall, head on, and head to tail. The results were different than hypothesized, but consistent with the research studied. This experiment showed the different impact forces of our test vehicles. This project is important because it can help keep people and animals in cars safe and help us learn more about physics.

What a great way to design an experiment using items you had at home-remote control cars. Your analysis was spot-on! Good job!
