Pop Rocks and Soda
Chemical Sciences

Chandra Sheppard Class
Grade:
2

Teacher:
Chandra Sheppard

The purpose of this experiment is to see which soda creates the most gas when pop rocks are added. I became interested in this experiment when we watched a news story where they added pop rocks and diet Pepsi. The information gained through this experiment will inform us on which soda creates the most gas bubbles in our stomachs.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
