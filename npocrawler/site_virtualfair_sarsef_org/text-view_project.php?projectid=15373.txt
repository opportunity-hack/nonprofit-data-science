A Virtual Environment for Socializing During the Pandemic

I am creating a multiplayer game in which each player has an avatar that they can control, allowing them to interact with friends. Because of the pandemic, I wanted to create an environment where friends could play safely. I created a prototype which allowed two or more people to connect through the internet. This game allows socially distanced friends to safely interact. Beyond the pandemic, this game has applications for hospital patients, individuals with mobility issues or any other situation requiring distancing.
