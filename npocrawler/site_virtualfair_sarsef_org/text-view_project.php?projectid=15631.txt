1. This project examined which car color (red, black, white, or grey) gets hottest in the sun.
2. I wanted to test the theory of car color making a temperature difference.
3. I found that black cars are hottest then, red, grey and white was coolest
4. This is important information for when you are buying a car.
This project has been cleared by SRC.


Comments

Great information! I knew I was more uncomfortable in my old black car for a reason :) I'll definitely be sticking with lighter colors in the future.
