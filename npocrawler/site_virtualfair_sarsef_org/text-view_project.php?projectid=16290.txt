How Does Your Heart Change With Exercise?
Health and Wellness

Avery Flowers
Grade:
6

Teacher:
MariAnn Slater

In this experiment I am going to test how the heart rate changes with different types of exercise.


 I wanted to do this experiment because I want to learn more about heart health.  I am a dancer and gymnast, so I wanted to learn  more about my heart and how it works. The information gained from this will help other people know that your heart is the most important muscle in your body and you need to take care of it as best as you can.


3. The results of the experiment were expected. My  hypothesis was supported in this experiment. Running does make your heart rate go up the most. The first trail I did my resting heart rate was 88 and my heart rate after running was 176. In the second trail my resting heart rate was 86 and after my heart rate was 178.  In the third trail my resting heart rate was 78 and after my heart rate was 180.  In the fourth trail my resting heart rate was 83 and after my heart rate was 182.  And in the last  trail my resting heart rate was 80 and after my heart rate was 185.

4.  This project is important because it is good for people who have heart conditions and that are looking into exercise.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
