This science experiment seeks an answer to how golf club shaft flex and weight impact overall golf performance. This data will benefit golfers by helping them choose the better shaft to improve their golf performance. This experiment will rely on physics and sports science to calculate golf performance through distance achieved, ball speed, ball spin, and swing speed. The data collection about how shaft flex and weight will contribute to the golfer’s overall performance will help golfers improve their game. This experiment found the ideal golf club shaft to be a regular flex 50 gram shaft which had just enough flexibility and weight to achieve the best golf performance.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
