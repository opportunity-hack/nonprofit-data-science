I am in 6th grade and I am a student at Broman K8 School in Tucson, Arizona. I have always loved geodes and rocks ever since I was a little girl. I would go outside and hunt for rocks. I always loved to show my rock to other people.

I am doing this science experiment because I always loved rocks and I always wondered can you grow them because I heard that you can grow them by doing this experiment. I am curious to see What happens if hot water and the Alum powder mix? Will more crystals grow on sideways or would more grow standing up?
This project has been cleared by SRC.
