What is your project about?

My project was about how temperature and humidity affects a tornado’s strength.


Why did you choose this project?

I choose this project because tornadoes are one of the most destructive forces on our planet and there are still many unknowns about them. It was due to these reasons that I was drawn to this project. 

What was your result/overall conclusion?

Temperature and humidity definitely has an effect on a tornado. It’s the differential between warm or hot conditions below the storm and cold air above the storm that truly can determine how strong the tornado will be. Other factors that influence a tornado include wind speed, size, geography of the land, and humidity in the air. Also, the longer the tornado exists the stronger it will become. 

Why is your project important?
It helps us understand the perfect combination of weather conditions required to ignite a powerful and deadly tornado.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
