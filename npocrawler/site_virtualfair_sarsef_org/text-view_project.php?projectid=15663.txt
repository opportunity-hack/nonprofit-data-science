Desperately Seeking Sunlight

My project seeks to answer the phenomenon of how far would a plant go to obtain or hide from the light that they need to grow? I chose this project because I have an interest in plants and the environment and I wanted to answer a question that I didn't know the answer to. In my hypothesis I was trying to prove that plants will navigate their way through a maze in order to get the sunlight that they need to grow. I knew that plants sought light and learned through my research that plants would react to different stimuli to grow and survive. My project is important because people may face other obstacles which could prevent outdoor growing, preventing an abundance of food supply. By learning about how plants grow to obtain or hide from light, I am learning about what I can do (and asking more questions) about the future of agriculture.

Great design on your "obstacles" for growth. Simple yet effective.
Great photo documentation. Photos can capture information better than words in many cases. Your photos definitely told the story.
