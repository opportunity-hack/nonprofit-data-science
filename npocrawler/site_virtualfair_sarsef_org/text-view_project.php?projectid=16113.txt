Going Green With Greywater

Grade:

Teacher:
Ivan D Yocum

The purpose of my science fair project is to record the amount of
greywater we could use from my house and to evaluate how much money and fresh water we could save by utilizing grey water. 

•I learned that my family does use the shower and the washing machine, on average (if slightly above), like other Tucson families. I was able to determine that we use massive amounts of water during irrigation times in the early morning. This usage sends our bill into the higher tier prices ranges for Tucson Water. 

This project is important because one of the results of climate change is much less water for our water supply. We need to incorporate water saving practices in our homes.
This project has been cleared by SRC.


Comments

Projects about saving water are important project to do and study. Good research and interesting conclusion.  Very important to learn to read a water meter and understand your water bill.
It is really nice how you are expanding on many ways to use a resource that some people don't even know about
Nice Job Brady Congrat!
Interesting Project
