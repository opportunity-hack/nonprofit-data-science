My project is about testing the ability of four different box reinforcements which include, reinforced joints, cardboard-liners, duct tape, and packing peanuts. Each of these reinforcements will be tested in a water, weight, and impact tests. I chose this project because currently, people ship packages around the world, and it’s important to protect the product. When all the testing was over, the package with packing peanuts was the most effective, while the package with duct tape was the least effective. My project is important because millions of packages get damaged each year, and with reinforcements that can secure the box, it’s possible to fix this issue and make products safe and sound.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
