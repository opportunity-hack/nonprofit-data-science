Bioinformatics, Unilateral Incompatibility, Plant Genomics, Differential Analysis
 My project tests a bioinformatic pipeline for differential analysis between Solanum pennellii pistils before and after flowering to determine genes related to unilateral incompatibility. I chose this project because I'm interested in genomics and plant sciences. The overall results have yet to be analyzed. This project is important because this bioinformatic pipeline will be applied to the tomato plant genome project studying heat tolerance and will further research on unilateral incompatibility.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
