Friction Power
Energy and Environmental Engineering

In this project the experimenter attempted to find a way to gain infinite power through friction. To do this, a bike wheel and dynamo were used to generate power which was stored in a battery.  Power was generated, but it was realized that one cannot create energy out of nothing to achieve this goal.
This project has been cleared by SRC.


Comments

Interesting methods for charging a battery.  How many times did you repeat the process for each of the methods you used to charge a battery.  This type of project could be continued.  Good job.
