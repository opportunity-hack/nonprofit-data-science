HS-BE033
The Effects of Hours Spent on Schoolwork on Students Mental Health
Behavioral and Social Science

Grade:

Elyse Wexler

My project is about how time spent working on school impacts high school students feelings. I chose this project because many of my peers have experienced increasing stress and tiredness and I wanted to understand how time management and time spent on working impacted them, especially since I've heard about how time management helps plenty of times. The more time a student spends on homework, the more negatively their feelings are impacted. This project is important in understanding what's an okay amount of homework to give students and to be mindful of time working and its effects.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
