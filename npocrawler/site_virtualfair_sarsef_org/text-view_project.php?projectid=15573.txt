The object of my project is to investigate the correlation between decreasing levels of pH, and the number of Anabaena cyanobacteria present in a given volume of water. I chose this project because the effects of climate change on the ocean's microbial ecosystems greatly interest me. After testing, I concluded that the amount of Anabaena cyanobacteria decreased when the pH decreased, which proved my hypothesis correct. My project is important because it directly pertains to current ocean conditions, and shows how climate change will impact microbial ecosystem.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
