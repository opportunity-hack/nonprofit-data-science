My project is about how the number of different species in one area change over time after a fire. I chose this project because I saw a fire last summer and I wanted to see what happened after the fire. I found that biodiversity increased in the years after a fire. The mountains surrounding Tucson have some of the most biodiversity in the world.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Nice work on a timely project
This is a fascinating experiment because it helps us see what will happen in the future. Incredible job!
Wow, what a great project! You did a great job analyzing your results and your presentation was very clear. I only wish I could have had a chance to talk to you about your project. Maybe next year!
