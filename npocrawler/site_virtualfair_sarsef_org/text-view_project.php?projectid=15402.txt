This project is about how wheather or not water could affect bacterial growth. At first when science fair came to play during this school year I was really hoping to do something with anything florescent or anything in the field of biology or chemistry. I chose this topic cause in my house sense of covid I always heard that the uv light could help kill the bacteria and as well sense water could carry certain bacteria from a place to another. I wanted to know for sure df it was true or not. I believe that this is important sense, bacteria could cause illness or just make people sick. I wanted to know if this was true in order to help my family have a cleaner environment.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
