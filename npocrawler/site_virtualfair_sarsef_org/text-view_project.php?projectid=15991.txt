Can a Small Levee Decrease the Height of Water in a Dip During a Flash Flood?
Energy and Environmental Engineering

Grade:

Ms.Wexler

1. My project is testing if a levee can help slow the rate of water coming through a road dip. 
2. I chose this project because during monsoon season here in Arizona, many people get stuck in road dips due to flash floods.
3. The levee was proven to be successful. It helped regulate and maintain the water levels on the other side of the levee. 
4. Maybe one day levees like mine could be installed in real life road dips, helping to save cars and lives.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
