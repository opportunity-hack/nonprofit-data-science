How Does One’s Skin Tone Affect the Amount of Perceived Racial Discrimination?
Behavioral and Social Science

Grade:
HS

Elyse Wexler

This project was about finding a correlation between skin tone and how often people of different skin tones face racial discrimination. I chose this project because I wanted to understand if racial discrimination was based off heritage or solely skin color. There was also a scene in the movie Harriet in which the lightest black woman was used as a cover to portray a white man in order to save the rest of the enslaved people and I wanted to see if that was also applied to this modern era. This project is important because it talks about a problem that is deeply rooted in American history and applies it to real-life situations. By understanding the roots of racial discrimination, it will in turn be easier to combat systemic racism in the long run.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
