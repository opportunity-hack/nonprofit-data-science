Health and Wellness

Our hypothesis stated that if junk food is eaten then junk food will make your blood pressure increase because it is bad for the heart and it contains lots of salt which make blood pressure increase. Our hypothesis was correct because on the graph when we were testing the experiment, all junk food made blood pressure increase while all healthy food was just going up a little bit.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
