How Sharp Are Your Math Skills?
Behavioral and Social Sciences

In this experiment we will find out if the activity you do affects your math skills. I chose this project because I wanted to know how do activities like coding, outdoor exercise, and video games affect your
math skills? I found that coding helps to improve your math skills the most. I want to be a teacher when I grow up so I want to know what will help my students learn better.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Wow, I would have thought the same as you... looks like I need to pick up coding :)  Well done, Thanks.
I love this project because I now know to not play video games because it can sometimes affect my math skill!
