HS-EA020
Contaminant Levels in Commercially Bottled Water
Earth and Environmental Science

1. My project is about the contaminant levels of iron, lead, and nitrate in commercially bottled water tap, Dasani, and Fiji.
2. I chose this project because the cleanliness of water we as Americans and people all over the world drink is important to me.
3. The price of water greatly impacted the levels of iron and nitrate in the water samples, for Fiji in five trials the results were 0,0,0,0,0.2 mL and for nitrate in tap water the results were 0.5, 0.7,0.9, 0.4, 0.3 mL. The process of reverse osmosis in commercially bottled water substantially decreases the levels of nitrate and iron. 
4. My project is important because when we learn our water is not as clean as we believed it to be we can push for stricter laws on the treatment of our water.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

There is lots to learn about something as basic as water.  Nice work.
