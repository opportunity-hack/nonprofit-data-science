This project puts flexibility to the test.  Can you improve flexibility in your hamstrings and lower back in just five minutes a day for five weeks?  My results indicate that you can improve flexibility that quickly. Every person that participated increased their flexibility to some extent.  This project is important knowledge in the world of health, fitness, and exercise to understand what the human body is capable of in small increments of time.  This data would encourage people to put effort into increasing flexibility and improving their back and leg health.
