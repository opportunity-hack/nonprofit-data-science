1.In this experiment I will be testing different genres of music on people to see how it affects their heart rate
2. I chose this project because I like to write songs and they are
supposed to be relaxing so I want to know how to do that. Therefore, This experiment is going to help me determine how music affects your heart rate. 
3. The data in this experiment shows that the participants averaged a 1.6 increase of heart rate for county music, a 4.4 in rock, and a 7 in the pop genre. 
4. My project is important because it will help determine how music affects your heart rate.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
