How Does Sunlight Affect Rubber Bands??
Chemical Science

Grade:

Teacher:
Marisa Kleiman

My project is about the effect of sunlight on rubber bands. I chose this project because I noticed that plastic toys and other items get brittle and faded after they have been outside for a long time and I wondered if the same thing happened to rubber bands. The result of my project was that rubber bands left outside in the sun degrade and lose stretchiness. My project is important because it can help scientists make new materials that are less likely to degrade in the sun.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
