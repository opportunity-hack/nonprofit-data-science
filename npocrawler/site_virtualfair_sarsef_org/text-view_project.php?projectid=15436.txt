Which Type of Water Makes A Plant Grow the Best?
Animal and Plant Sciences

Grade:

Determining which type of water works best to have the most growth on a plant. I used sink/tap water, distilled water and bottled water. I used the same exact plants in the same size pots. I watered these plants twice a week and measured them once a week for 28 days. The measurements surprised me. I thought the distilled water would make a plant grow the most but instead it was the tap/sink water. After the research I did I found out it was because tap/sink water has a lot of minerals and things in it. But the distilled water I learned the process of how it is made and learned that everything is taken out of this water. So the results made more sense to me after doing my research.
This project has been cleared by SRC.


Comments

I like how you saw the need for consistency, by using same size plants, same size pots and careful measuring of the water. Consistency is important in science work.
