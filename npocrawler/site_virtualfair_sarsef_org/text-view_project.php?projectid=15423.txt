Dynamic Agrivoltaics - Boosting Performance by Adding Movement to Solar Panels
Earth and Environmental Science

Grade:
HS

Teacher:
Derek Roth Gordon

This project is a continuation of work I did last year showing the benefits of agrivoltaics where combining agriculture and solar power (photovoltaics) together in shared land use creates more plant growth and more electricity generation on less land. This year, I experimented with dynamic agrivoltaics, testing the impact of solar panels that move throughout the day to follow the sun. If this resulted in more plant growth and electricity generation, agrivoltaics could have an even bigger environmental impact. The result of my experiment was that plants grown under these dynamic panels grew taller and leaves grew wider while using less water than plants grown under fixed panels. The solar panels themselves generated more power than fixed panels as well. These results are very important for the arid farmlands of Arizona, where agrivoltaics could results in better water management, increased plant yields, and more energy created.

Congratulations on your $100 Energy Solutions Award for innovation, excellent research, and professional presentation!
Nice joy Henry! Love all of those graphs and charts. Lots of work went into this! I just love the idea of dynamic panels and how they follow the sun. Way to go! love, Aunt Rachel (OH)
