Climate change and global warming are hurting life on earth. One way of slowing down climate change is to exchange fossil fuels for biofuels. Scientists have started looking at algae as a source of oil for biofuel and methods for mass production of algae would be necessary in solving this problem. Algae needs sunlight (or another form of energy), water, CO2, and inorganic nutrients to grow. 

This experiment tested to see if the volume of water mattered in the growth of algae. Algae was harvested from a local pond and was grown in one of three different sizes of containers (128 fl oz, 64 fl oz, or 32 fl oz) .

 Four samples of each condition were grown for 6 weeks.  As hypothesized, the results found that algae grown in the largest volume of water grew more than in the smaller volume water conditions. This suggests that the volume of water may be an important factor in developing the best environment for the mass production of algae. 

 Finding the best environment to allow for mass production of algae is very important in the production of biofuel and to decrease the speed of climate change.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
