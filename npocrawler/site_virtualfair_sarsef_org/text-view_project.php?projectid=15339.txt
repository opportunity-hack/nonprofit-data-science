Do Cats Purr-fer Circles?
Behavioral and Social Sciences

Grade:

Teacher:

I wanted to know if cats are attracted to circles in particular or if they like sitting in other shapes, too. I became interested in this cat behavior after I saw many images on the internet showing cats sitting in circles made of various materials (paint, tape, socks, balls of yarn, etc.). What I discovered was that my cats aren't interested in sitting in circles or other shapes unless I draw them toward the shape with the offer of treats. This makes me wonder if the cats in those photos on the internet were also lured by  treats.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
