Brain Drain From Screens, Is It Real?
Behavioral and Social Science

Grade:
8

Teacher:
David Ficke

My project is about how non educational screen time can affect your brain and your mood. I chose this topic because excessive non educational screen time can be very bad and can have terrible negative effects; I want to research these effects and warn people to limit their screen time. My overall conclusion was that screen time does not have visible negative effects until you have too much, there is a limit to how much screen time you can have before you actually have bad negative effects. My project is important because it can show people and motivate people to limit their non educational screens or bad things will happen.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

A interesting project with an important topic. Very comploete background researach and conclusions that reinforce your hypothesis.  Yes, the more subjects, the more validity.  Good job.
