This project endeavors to find replacement small molecules for Basic Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF-2) to bind to the Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 1 (FGFR1). I chose this project because it seemed very interesting to me, and I wanted to learn more about stem cells. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) were fed media and treated with 9 small molecules selected based on in-silico docking experiments of active site 1FQ9. Results show promise for 5 of these molecules and open new research opportunities for studying FGF/FGFRs and could lead to stem cell research being much more accessible.\
This project has been cleared by SRC.
