My project tests if having magnets in Rubik’s cubes and the strength of them affects the overall solve time. I chose this project because I have been speed-solving for a while and always used magnetic cubes without knowing what their actual effect is. The results showed that having magnets increases the speed of a solve and gives you faster times. This project is important because it lets people know that magnets actually do have an effect and are worth paying extra money for.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
