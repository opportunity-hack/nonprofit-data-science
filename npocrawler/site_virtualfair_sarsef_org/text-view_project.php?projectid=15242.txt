Our project is designed to determine what kind of soap will make the longest lasting bubble solution (hand, dish, or body wash). We chose this project because our class is especially motivated by bubbles and interested in how they work. Our prediction is that the dish soap will last the longest because it is "thicker". Our project is important because we will be able to create a longer lasting bubble solution to use in our classroom.
This project has been cleared by SRC.


Comments

Doing the bubble experiment was fun. I liked how you recorded your results making your graph. Having 1/8 teaspoon measure was a good standard.
Everyone loves bubbles.  You got a chance to learn and play at the same time!
Interesting concept about bubbles! I loved how you implemented ideas and created this! - Venkata Manikonda
