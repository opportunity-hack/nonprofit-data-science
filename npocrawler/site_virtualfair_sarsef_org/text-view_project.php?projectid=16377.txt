The Ice Project
Earth and Environmental Sciences

Adina Karp Class
Grade:
2

Teacher:
Adina Karp

The ice project focused on whether the amount of ice put into a water bottle would affect how quickly the ice would melt. Students chose this project because they were curious about how they could keep the water in their water bottle cold for as long as possible. The result of the project showed that the more ice that was added, the longer it took for the ice to melt, however, throughout the project, students realized the various variables that affected the results of their experiment. This project is important because it answered a question that students wondered about and allowed the students to explore the scientific method.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
