Article vs. Infographic: What Do Students Remember Better?
Behavioral and Social Science

Talya O'Neil
Grade:
8

Teacher:
Mrs. Lara Huetter

In this project I tested whether students remember information better if it is presented in an article or infographic format. My results showed that students who read the infographic remembered better, and scored 12% better on a test. I chose this project because I have always felt that it is hard to remember information from long articles. This project could help educators know how to teach students more successfully.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
