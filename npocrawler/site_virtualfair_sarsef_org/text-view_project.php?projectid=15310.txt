Walking With Chickens: An Excercise Study
Animal and Plant Sciences

Grade:

Teacher:
Jeannette Olsson

Do chickens become healthier when given more attention? Using three chickens, I walked one, played with another, and left the third alone as a control. I weighed them before and after the experiment to find out if their weight changed. The one that gained the most weight was the one I played with and the one that gained the least was the control chicken. I believe that playing with chickens increases their health and happiness.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

I absolutely love that you used chickens for your project!  I grew up with pet chickens that would fall asleep on my lap.  Excellent job on your project!
Great idea and nice project!
What a clever project and an important question to research. great job!
Good that you have a "control" chicken. That gives you a baseline to compare changes with those chickens that you tested.
I really liked that project:) I should play with my chickens more. I learned a lot!!!
I like it
