I designed a prototype that cleans paint brushes affectively while using less water.  All of the prototypes were able to clean the brushes with the goal of using less water, but some more effectively than others. This is a simple way to consereve water that can be used in schools, art studios or even at home.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
