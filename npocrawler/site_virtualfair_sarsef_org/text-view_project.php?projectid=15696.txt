My Project is about an object that can keep your food warm or cold that floats in the pool it is ideal in what summers when you need cold food.

Why did you choose this project?

I chose this project because my family and I use the pool a lot in the summer and want snacks, but also keep it dry but never want to get out of the pool.


What was your result/overall conclusion?

My overall conclusion was that styrofoam is a good material and works well with all standards and that the prototype worked very well in its last modification.

Why is your project important?

My project is important because it helps many families like mine have food in the pool without having to worry about cold or warmth and keeping it dry.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
