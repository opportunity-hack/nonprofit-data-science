HS-MI006
Charred, Cooked, Raw? The Optimum Size and  Density to Cook Ground Meat to Minimize Exposure to Carcinogens and Campylobacter

My project is about how to minimize the amount of Campylobacter and Salmonella growth as well as the amount of carcinogens on pan-cooked ground beef-based dishes simply by optimizing the density and volume of the chunks you prepare. I chose this project because while I was reading a paper about Salmonella I learned how common place the food poisoning cases are and that one of the most common reasons is the consumption of raw or improperly cooked meat. I decided that simple and scientifically proven measures may save lives or prevent serious illness, making the outcomes of this study very significant and applicable. My overall result was that as the chunk density decreases or volume increases, so does the proportion of the raw meat to the well cooked meat. This project is important because it provides a simple yet vital understanding of how to prepare meat for cooking to avoid serious diseases.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
