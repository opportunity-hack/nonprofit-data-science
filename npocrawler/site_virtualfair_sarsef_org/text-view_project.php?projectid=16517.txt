This student project tested the effects of different liquids on Conversation Candy hearts.  She used different liquids in her house to see which of them dissolved the hearts the most effectively.  Her result was surprising, since the salt water dissolved the candy heart the best. This was due to the salinity causing the heart to float and dissolve from all sides.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

hmmm, I wouldn't have guessed.  How clever of you to use the colors to represent the different liquids.  Nice job
