Comparing five different hand sanitizing products to see which one sanitizes the best. The goal of this project was to help people decide which hand sanitizing product is effective and which ones to avoid. The best product for reduction of bacteria on my hands was 0.3% Benzalkonium Chloride product (reduced bacteria by 84%) and the worst product for reduction of bacteria was electrolyzed water (reduced bacteria by 67%). This project is important because during this pandemic, it has shown me that people need to make informed decisions to use a product that will keep them and their family safest from bacterial infections.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
