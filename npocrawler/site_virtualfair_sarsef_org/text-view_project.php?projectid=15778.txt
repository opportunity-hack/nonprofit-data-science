I was interested in if regular sugar would dissolve faster than artificial sugar. I am interested in chemical reactions.
This project has been cleared by SRC.


Comments

Did you consider the fact that these two gummy bears may have other differences, besides sugar and artificial sugar? Any differences observed could be due to those differences.
Nice work! It would be interesting to see if it makes a difference in cooking too.
