Qualitative Analysis of Gene Expression Profiles of IFN-B treated and Treatment-Naive MS Patients

My project is about finding out why IFN-B treatment, a popular therapy was ineffective in treating Multiple Sclerosis (MS). I chose my project because I had read about MS earlier in the year to try to diagnose my mother's debilitating symptoms and my dream is to be a neurosurgeon or a specialist in the brain, so I was excited to put my passion in finding help for my mother and to begin my dream. Overall, I found that IFN-B expresses several genes that help the disease while also not affecting most of the genes involved in the disease. My project is important because I explained why DMTs are ineffective and I found several harmful genes which need to be avoided in future production of therapies in treating not just MS, but also other auto-immune diseases.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
