ABCalc - Reinventing How Woodworkers Calculate Board Footage. (or just “ABCalc” for short)

What is your project about?
My project is about making it easier for woodworkers to calculate board footage through a simple to use, yet feature rich app.

Why did you choose this project?
I chose this project because my dad owns the Woodcraft franchise in Tucson, and because he calculates board footage a lot, he could benefit from this project and the time it saves rather than using a calculator and piece of paper or a standard board foot calculator.

What was your result/overall conclusion?
The result of my project was an app that saves up to two times the amount of time compared to all other methods of calculating board footage.

Why is your project important?
My project is important because it helps woodworkers calculate the amount of wood they need for a project quicker so they can get on to making whatever they wish to make.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
