This project investigated which house plants produced the most oxygen.  While collecting flowers to make floral paper at home during COVID quarantine, I collected flowers in zip-lock bags and noticed that some produced moisture in the bags.  Upon more investigation into photosynthesis, I wanted to see which house plants would help give more oxygen at home, because we were stuck inside the house and my brother has asthma.  My conclusion found that the darker and plants with thicker leaves produced the most oxygen.  This is important because plants can give oxygen and help people stuck indoors and with breathing problems.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
