I wanted to know how much iron is in cereal.  I chose this project because I am interested in health.  I learned that my food choices can be influenced by advertising.  This is important to other kids to know so they can make healthy food choices.
This project has been cleared by SRC.


Comments

I really like that you compared your results to the nutrition facts on the box for each cereal!
I liked your project and your conclusion!  You are so right about food advertisements and making food look healthy when they are not.  Good discovery!  Good job!
