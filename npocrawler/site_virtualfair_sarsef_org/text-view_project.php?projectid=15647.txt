My project focuses on the principles of Bernoulli's theory - specifically the relationship between air/fluid and pressure.  I found it fascinating that his rules could fit into so much of our modern-day transportations.  I found that warmer, faster pressurized air flows the fastest.  The principles are important because the fluid dynamics help us learn how to control a moving object at high velocities.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
