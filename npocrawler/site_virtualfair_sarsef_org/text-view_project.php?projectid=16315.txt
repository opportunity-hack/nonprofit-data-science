In the COVID 19 pandemic masks have become a divisive issue. In this study, nineteen girls, 11-14 years old, went through two workouts. They wore masks in the first workout and no masks in the second workout. The heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation were taken before and after the workout. The results showed that the heart rate and respiratory rate of the participants went up along with the oxygen saturation of the participants. Although an increased heart rate and respiratory rate are seen as negatives, the improved oxygen saturation benefited the participants because it meant that they had more oxygen in their blood.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
