The purpose of this research is to determine the most magnetic metals and what temperatures
could weaken a magnet. I got inspiration for my project from an apex magnets article titled
'Magnet experiments: What happens when a magnet is heated'. I based my experiment loosely on
this piece of writing. I found that my hypothesis was accepted by the experiment as the magnet
that was heated at 400 degrees Fahrenheit (204.44 degrees Celsius) hardly picked up anything
versus the magnet that was heated at 200 degree Fahrenheit (93.33 degrees Celsius). My experiment can help engineers acknowledge the importance of keeping magnets cool.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
