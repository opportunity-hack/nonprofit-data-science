Nature vs. Nurture: Barrel Cactus Seeds

Do you think a part of your garden or yard has more pollinators than in the wild? I wondered this when I noticed the barrel cactus fruit in our garden. My hypothesis was that the garden barrel cactus fruit  had more seeds than in the wild. The experimental results proved that my hypothesis was wrong because the cactus fruit had more seeds in the wild than in the garden. I believe this is because there are far more pollinators in the wild than in the garden. My project is important because it helps prove that garden barrel cactus fruit will hold the same amount of seeds regardless of where they are planted which is useful for growing.

I liked that you kept your plant and fruit size the same,limiting the variables made it easier to compare.
i hoped you wore gloves and used tongs.
Wonderful job counting all those seeds on those cactus fruit. I like how to included a prediction of what you thought you might have in each one. That gave a nice frame of reference.
An interesting idea and a good way to learn more about the natural desert plants.  Hope you continue to think of new ways to explore and learn.
