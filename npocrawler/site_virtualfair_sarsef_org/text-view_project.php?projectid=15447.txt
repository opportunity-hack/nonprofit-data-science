Identifying People With Synesthesia
Behavioral and Social Sciences

Lourdes Class
Grade:
4

Teacher:
Lourdes

Our class designed a survey to help us identify students and family members with synesthesia. We analyzed the responses to our survey to see if could find that people have the characteristics and if it matched the typical 3-4% of the population that has this difference. As we looked over the data, we developed a second question, how does synesthesia affect thinking. We created a follow-up survey to find connections between synesthesia and learning.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
