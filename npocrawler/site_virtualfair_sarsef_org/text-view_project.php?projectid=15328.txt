This project aims to investigate any correlations relating to COVID-19 cases and deaths and other state-wide and global data including Average Income and Education Funding. We chose this project because we are currently in a pandemic and we were curious as to what might be causing the differences in transmission and deaths throughout our country and the world. We are still analyzing the data so we do not yet have an overall conclusion. This project is important because it can provide information about what might be influencing rates and deaths during a pandemic and how society can better reduce these.
