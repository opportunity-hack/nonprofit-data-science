HS-MI007
The Effect of Acetone Concentration on E. coli Growth
Microbiology

Jenine Annett
Grade:
HS

Teacher:
Michael Frank, PhD

My project is about the effect that acetone has on E. coli growth. I chose this project because currently, there is no cure for an E. coli infection, and I wanted to see if certain chemicals may be able to negatively impact E. coli growth and possibly cure an infection. Overall, acetone had a negative effect on E. coli growth, causing a border to form around the filter papers that were treated with acetone. It is imperative that humanity test different chemicals and their effectiveness towards bacteria in order to find new cures for ailments, because the cure for an illness may be found in our own homes
This project has been cleared by SRC.
