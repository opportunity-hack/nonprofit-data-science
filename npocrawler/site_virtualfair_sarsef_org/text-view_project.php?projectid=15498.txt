Trash Equals Energy
Energy and Environmental Engineering

Our project is creating an in-home system that we put trash in and then collect methane as the trash breaks down to generate electricity. We chose this because we’ve been studying landfills for our SARSEF projects for the last three years, and we feel this would reduce trash at the landfill, and as well as reduce the need for fossil fuels for energy. We were able to collect enough methane to light a bunson burner with our system. Our project is important because it would improve global warming in several different ways.

Great research and ideas!
Excellent work.  Multi-year project is terrific and notebook is well done. Did you enjoy the coco?
Amazing analysis on how trash is a source of energy. It is very interesting how trash and energy and similar!
Wow, what an amazing project! You found a real-world problem and found an easy solution at home with regular household objects. It was a great idea to meet with employees at the landfill for research.
What a great project! I especially love "Anything for science!" picture. Keep up the good work. I wonder if you will do more research on this, you have already done a lot, or move on to something new?
Very cool idea! I did not know that trash could make energy.
