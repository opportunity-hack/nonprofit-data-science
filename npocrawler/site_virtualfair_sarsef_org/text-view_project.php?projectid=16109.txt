Which Mask Is Best in the Fight Against Covid - 19?
Health and Wellness

Ivan D Yocum

Our project focuses on the components of what make the best mask for our current Covid-19situation. 

We decided to conduct this experiment and do a project on it because we were intrigued by the topic and we were inspired to pick something relevant to our lives.

 Out of the three masks tested, we came to the conclusion that the standard blue medical mask stole the show. In making this decision we took into account the cost, availability, and protection of the
masks.

Our project is important because in order to help conclude this pandemic everyone has to chip in, and our project does just that. The information that we have collected can be useful to people who don’t know what to do and it is important to education the uneducated.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
