Good journal!
This experiment is clean and is conducted very well! The ideas you used here to create this experiment is innovative and imaginative! Fantastic Job!
What a great idea for a project! And you found something to do with your candy canes besides eat them. This took a lot of care and patience. Did you know at Disneyland, they make homemade candy canes?
