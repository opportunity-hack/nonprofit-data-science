1. In this experiment I am going to test five different paper airplane designs and see
which one goes the farthest.
2. I chose this project because my dad is a pilot and airplanes have always
fascinated me.
3. In conclusion paper airplane number five went the farthest.
4. My project is important because it may help plane designers release drag.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
