Create a peaceful lighting system to help people relax. We wanted to engineer a light display to help people stressed during the quarantine. Most people felt that the system did help them feel better. This is important for physical and mental health especially at this time when people have more than the normal amount of stress.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
