This project is about looking at how certain activities changed from before to during the Pandemic and how limitations of activities (maintaining routine, exercise, hobbies, and social connectedness) due to the Pandemic linked to mental health. I chose to do this project because I found the pandemic to be a very prominent part of my life in 2020. The overall conclusion of our project was that maintaining routines and meeting exercise goals did change from before to during the pandemic. We also concluded that maintaining routine, exercise, and engaging hobbies negatively correlated with DASS, while maintaining routine negatively correlated with STAIS. This project is important because it brings light to mental health and how the Pandemic impacted activities in peoples lives, which extended to impacting their mental health.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
