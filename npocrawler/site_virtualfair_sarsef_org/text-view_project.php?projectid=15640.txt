Students all over the world are searching for a way to better their test scores, and chewing gum while studying just may be the answer. In this experiment, you will learn about the effectiveness of different flavors of chewing gum and whether or not they can improve students' test scores. I chose to research this issue further because I wanted to find a solution for myself and my classmates to improve our overall test scores. In the end, I discovered that chewing gum while learning new material does in fact raise students' test scores, and those chewing sugar-free bubblegum had the highest average score on a random knowledge test.

Interesting topic, and a surprising conclusion.  I'm curious how the sugar-free piece played a part.  Good information and well done.  Keep it up.
