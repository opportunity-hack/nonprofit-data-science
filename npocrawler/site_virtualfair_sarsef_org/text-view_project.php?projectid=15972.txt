Good Job! You expressed everything that is needed here in a clear fashion and this is really good advice  for people today! Great work!
Thank you for this great project.  I learned something new from you today.  I learned that we sneeze at 100  Kilometers.  Well done!  Keep teaching others about science!
I really loved the details you included in your project! The images were a great addition as well!
