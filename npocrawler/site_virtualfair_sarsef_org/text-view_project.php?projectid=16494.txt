How Do Colored Fonts Affect Reading Speed ?
Behavioral and Social Science

Sophia Schumack
Grade:
8

Teacher:
MariAnn Slater

1. In this experiment I will be testing how colored fonts affect
reading speed in children grades 1-8.
2 . I chose this project because I am a very avid reader and am
genuinely interested in the topic because I myself struggle with
reading colored fonts at times .
3. My result was that younger kids do indeed struggle with
reading colored fonts and with that data I was able to prove my
hypothesis as true .
4. My project is important because since children do struggle
more with reading colored fonts we should be teaching / working with
them to children in elementary/middleschool.And it is proven that in
reading with colored fonts different parts of your brain are triggered to
work differently an slightly harder , which can help with the childs
artistic side of the mind .
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Interesting topic/results.  You mentioned earlier that inexperience of a younger reader might also account for your results, in addition to colors.  Strange that beginner books use more colored fonts
