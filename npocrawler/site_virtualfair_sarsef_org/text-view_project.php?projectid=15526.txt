This project is about the design of the hull for a cargo ship. The goal of this project is making a cargo ship fast and stable. The final prototype allowed the boat to cross a pool faster than the other prototypes, and was able to withstand very big waves. This project is important because a well designed cargo boat hull will be safer and have a smaller impact on climate change.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
