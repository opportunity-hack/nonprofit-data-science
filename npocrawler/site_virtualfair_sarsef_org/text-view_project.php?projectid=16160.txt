My invention helps to solve the problem of oil and other things dripping down the side of a bottle when you pour. I noticed that when my mom is using oil and she sets the bottle down, some of the oil drips onto the counter. This can ruin wood or your counter and makes a mess to clean up. I invented a cloth bib that you attach to the bottle to absorb the oil instead of having it drip down onto the counter. My mom likes the idea because it gave her less of a mess to clean up when she is cooking. My project is important because no one wants to mess up their counter or have more messes to clean up in their kitchen. It can also be used for other bottles like shampoo, vinegar, milk etc.
