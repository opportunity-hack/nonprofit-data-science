My question is - can dogs see color?  I love dogs very much and I have a dog named Malie.  Last year, I studied all about dogs.  I learned that scientists proved dogs were color blind.  This led me to my question.  I found through my experiment that dogs can distinguish black for other colors.  Doing this experiment was important to me because if you would like to show your dog something, you should know what color it should be.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

So glad Malie gave you consent to test her :)  Interesting project, well done.
