My project is about recycling, and plastic pollution in the environment. I read about biodegradable plastic and wanted to see if I could create a straw out of bioplastic. I used an original recipe based on starch, and replaced the cornstarch from the first recipe with other starch types and came out with a product that was viable for use as a straw. It's an important project because petroleum based straws can take hundreds of years to decompose, where bioplastic straws can serve a one time function, and then breakdown and not create addition landfill spcae.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
