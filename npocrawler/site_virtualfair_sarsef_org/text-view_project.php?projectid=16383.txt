I love cookies! And I love dunking them in milk. I wanted to know which cookie is the best cookie to dunk in milk. Some cookies break apart in milk. Some cookies do not get soft enough in milk. The best cookie to dunk needs to get softer after dunking, not crumble into your cup of milk, and not drip milk on you when you eat it.

Which cookie is the best cookie to dunk in milk?

I think the Snickerdoodle will be the best cookie to dunk because it is hard. It will not get too soggy or crumbly because it is a hard cookie.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Thank you for doing this research! Now I will go get some Oreos to dunk in my milk and I will skip the other cookies.
Nice demonstration about how Milk and Cookies work! - Venkata Manikonda
Your ideas for future experiments are inspiring. It would not have occurred to me to try other milks to see if the results changed.
