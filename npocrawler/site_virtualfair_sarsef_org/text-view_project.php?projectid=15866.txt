Sourdough starter is made by waking up wild
yeast and bacteria naturally found in flour and giving them
what they need (food, liquid, warmth and time) to grow and
ferment. But, does the type and quality of the liquid you
use matter? My project tested the pH, Total Dissolved
Solids and Electrical Conductivity of 21 different liquids
(tap water from 18 places in the U.S., distilled water,
mineral water and apple juice) to make sure they are safe
to drink and use in food. Then, I mixed those liquids with
bread flour to make sourdough starters. As they grew, I
measured changes in the height of each starter along with
visual observations and any changes in aroma over a
7-day period to see which starter grew the most. My
hypothesis was that the starter made with tap water from
Steamboat Springs, CO would perform the best, but I was
incorrect. The Apple juice starter was by far the best
overall performer, while the starter with Norfolk, VA water
was the best performer among the tap waters.
This project has been cleared by SRC.


Comments

Wow, this is an impressive research project - great job!
Wow, you sure worked with a lot of samples! That's a lot of work to try so many different types of water. But at least you got some bread out of the experiment. Great job!
