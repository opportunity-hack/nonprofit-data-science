Are Candles Killing You?

My project was to determine if burning candles negatively affects air quality. I chose this project because my mom and I really like burning candles and we wanted to know if they could be negatively impacting our respiratory health. Overall, the candle I was the most worried about ended up being the safest to burn, while ones that used more natural ingredients ended up emitting higher levels of chemicals into the air. Candles are very popular, so it is important to know if they could negatively impacting our long term health.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
