This project looks at the effects of chemical oxybenzone in sunscreen on Artemia and on Phaseolus vulgaris Pinto Group. I chose this project to see the effects of oxybenzone on aquatic and terrestrial life and, to convey my data to explain how oxybenzone in effecting our environment. My results showed that any amount of Oxybenzone was inhabitable for brine shrimp and that at low and moderate levels, oxybenzone promoted sprouting in bean plants but over time and with higher concentrations plants suffered growing slower and becoming more fragile. This project is important because it shows that oxybenzone is harming plants and animals and if it were to limit any life it would simultaneously be harming other life such of predators. If Oxybenzone caused a shortage of a certain plant or animal species there would be a shortage of food for that creatures prey and the predator's predator and eventually for humans as well.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
