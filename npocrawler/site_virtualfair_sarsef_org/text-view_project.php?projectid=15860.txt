Why do you see stars at night and not during the day.  In studying astronomy, the students were wondering why they couldn't see stars during the day when the sun was a star and they could see it.  We found that the sun was closer to the Earth and that it blocked us from being able to see the other stars.  This was important to understand how the position of the Earth creates day and night.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Your topic was really interesting! Great project. I liked the photos you added to your report.
