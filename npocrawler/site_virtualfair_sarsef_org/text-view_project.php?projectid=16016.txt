My science fair project was about the melting and stretching of cheese based on the fat content. I have always loved to cook, and I had never made cheese before so I decided that it would be a challenge to try to make homemade cheese. We found that the cheese with the higher fat content melted quickest and stretched the furthest. The reason this is important how fat content affects the melting and stretching of cheese. This was helpful because I wanted a stretchy cheese for pizza.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
