8-CH004
What Insulator Is the Least Flammable?
Chemical Science

Peter D. Corrado
Grade:
8

Teacher:
Mrs. Ochoa

I am testing which insulator is the least flammable by placing them over two bricks over a birthday candle and lighting it to see which insulator which stands the heat and takes the longest to catch on fire. I chose this because I was interested in when we were learning about insulators during Science class. My result was that glass was the least flammable and styrofoam was the most. My project is important in case someone didn't know what insulator to use.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
