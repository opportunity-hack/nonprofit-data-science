The Effects of Light Color on Marigold Growth
Plant Science

Bennett Rich
Grade:
HS

Teacher:
Elaine MacKenzie

My project is about how different colors of light affect Marigold growth.  I chose this because it was relatively simple but still intriguing.  My results were that red light gives healthier and blue light gives good budding but only marginally.  This is important to see how different colors of light affect general plant growth.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
