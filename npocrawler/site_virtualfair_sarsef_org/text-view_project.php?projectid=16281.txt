Carbon dioxide is one of the essential elements required for plant growth.  Seltzer water, which is tap water infused with carbon dioxide, may help plant growth.  Previous studies showed that club soda or seltzer water helped plants grow two times as fast and tall.  The purpose of this study is to see if seltzer water will help plants grow faster than plants that received tap water.  Basil plants given tap water were compared to basil plants given seltzer water, over the span of six weeks.  This study suggests that seltzer water helps plants grow approximately two times greater in height and one and a half times greater in mass.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Nice experiment and it's predictable but it has a unique mind that is implemented into it - Venkata Manikonda
Nice job on a good project.
The graphs/charts are very helpful in understanding your results.
