This project is based on the Chemical Evolution Theory by Aleksandr Ivanovich Oparin and was supposed to determine whether it was possible for macromolecules to be created from inorganic sources. In this experiment, I tested for different types of macromolecules. This is an important experiment since, it is believed that organic sources turned into macromolecules but what if there was a chance that inorganic sources could have also turned into macromolecules therefore starting the chemical evolution. 
	Some of the materials needed to conduct this experiment were Erlenmeyer Flasks, salt water, crushed rock and sediments, methane gas, ice, airline tubing, clay, heat source, and an electric source. These materials were used to create the primordial soup to then be exposed to the heat and electricity. Then, The liquified vapor was tested for macromolecules with Biuret Reagent for proteins, Benedict’s solution for reducing sugars, Iodine Solution for starch, and 95% ethyl alcohol for nucleic acids. 
	Basing on the data and results of this experiment, I can say that there was no presence of any type of macromolecule in the mixture from inorganic solution. Therefore, according to our results organic substances such as carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, starch, and nucleic acids cannot be created from inorganic sources. Although, I was not able to create any macromolecules from inorganic sources this was a very interesting project in my opinion. 
	In conclusion, there were five trials for each type macromolecule none of which exhibited reactions from the reagents. Meaning the samples collected from the liquified vapor showed no evidence of macromolecules being present.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
