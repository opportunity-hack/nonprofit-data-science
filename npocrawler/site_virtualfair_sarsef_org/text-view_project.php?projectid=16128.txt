1. My project is about what people 10-17 years preference of books and video games are.

2. I chose this project because at the time, I loved to read and play video games, and I wanted to know what other people preferred. 

3. My results were that most people ( 63.63% ) preferred video games over ( 36.36%) preferred reading, what's interesting is that most of them think they will like reading more than video games in the future.

4. My project is important because we can see what the young people are doing with their free time because they are the future of our nation.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
