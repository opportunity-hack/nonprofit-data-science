1. The purpose of this experiment was to figure out how much drag clothes create compared
to a swimsuit.
2.
As a swimmer I have been curious how much drag do street clothes create.
3.
The results in this experiment tells me that the average time swimming a 25 meter with a
swimsuit is 15.9 seconds compared to swimming with street clothes which is 24.88
seconds. That due to the drag of the clothes swimming with street clothes is much more
difficult than swimming with a swimsuit.
4.
This is helpful because if you fall into a pool fully clothed you will right away be able to
estimate how much time and energy it takes you to swim to get out of the pool.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
