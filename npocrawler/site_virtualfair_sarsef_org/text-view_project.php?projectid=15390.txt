Ryan Larkin Class
Grade:
PK

Teacher:
Ryan Larkin

In our project, the students were hungry predators looking for prey. They had to see how much prey (M&Ms) they could find while some were camouflaged into their surroundings (Skittles). The students  were able to learn some adaptations animals use to survive in their harsh environments and learn about the circle of life.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
