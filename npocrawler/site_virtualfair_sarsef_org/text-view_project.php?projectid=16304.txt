Which Music is Better?
Behavioral and Social Science

Grade:

Teacher:
Suzanne Lasich

The problem to be solved in this experiment is that students sometimes get low grades, and maybe if listening to a specific type of music it will help them get a higher achievement. Therefore, listening to Jazz, Pop, or Classical music, it might affect the student’s performance.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
