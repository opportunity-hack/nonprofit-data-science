My project was about the most comfort you can get while playing games. The Relaxinator is a case that can hold a Nintendo and makes it easy to play sitting down. I chose this project because I love games and wanted to find better ways to play. We did end up making a thing to help us. This is important because there are a lot of people that play video games.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
