The Effect of pH Level on the Presence of E. coli and Coliform Bacteria in Pools

Ms.Wexler

The presence of E. coli and coliform bacteria is being measured in pools with varying pH levels. This project was chosen because of its involvement with residential swimming pools and their cleanliness, as people generally do not question the pool water levels submerging themselves in those unknown waters. In conclusion, the experiment demonstrated that pH level is not the only factor in encouraging or eliminating E. coli and coliform growth. The project is holds importance because it showed that residential pools are often not at recommended nor safe levels when being in use, and greater awareness should be spread on what microscopic dangers lurk in pools.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
