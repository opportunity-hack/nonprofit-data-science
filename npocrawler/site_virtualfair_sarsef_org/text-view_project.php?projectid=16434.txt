Which Water Is the Best for Your Oral  Health?
Chemical Science

Brady Byrd
Grade:
7

Teacher:
MariAnn Slater

1.My project is about oral health and the how the type of water you drink can affect it. 
2.I choose this project because I am interested in the study of oral health.
3.My result was that the natural spring water is the best water for your oral health containing the most neutral pH level.  
4. This information is important because it will teach people that natural spring water is the best for you and what the different pH levels of other waters are.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
