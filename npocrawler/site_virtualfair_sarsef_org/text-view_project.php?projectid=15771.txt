“Is it a Female or Male Thing?” is a project about how changing classrooms from in-person to online impacts the amount of participation in each gender. The project’s main focus if online classrooms truly achieve different things than an in-person classroom does, one being the amount of participation. Several classroom recordings of math,english,science, spanish, and history classes were looked at and data was taken on the amount of participation of each gender during class. Previous data and research shows that males were not always academically better than females but  have always been more dominant when it came to participation in class. This project depicts whether online learning changes that data that has been the same for as far as we can date back.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
