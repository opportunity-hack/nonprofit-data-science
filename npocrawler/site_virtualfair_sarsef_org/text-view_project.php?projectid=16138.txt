Do Masks Mask Your Emotions?
Behavioral and Social Sciences

Grade:
3

Teacher:
Mrs. Cornejo

My project is to determine if wearing masks during a pandemic impacts one's ability to read emotions. 5 subjects were photographed displaying 5 emotions - both with and without masks. These photos were shown to 110 individuals via social media, who then attempted to identify the emotion. The percentage of correct responses was then used to determine if the masks were indeed an impediment to reading emotions.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
