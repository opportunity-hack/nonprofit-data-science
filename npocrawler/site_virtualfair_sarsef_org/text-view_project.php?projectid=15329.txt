Measuring Racial Bias in Healthcare Workplaces

Elyse Wexler

Implicit bias are lurking variables in racial disparities within healthcare, education, incarceration rates -- and basically everything else.

Due to these factors, it is often difficult for people of color to find adequate healthcare services. I experienced this dilemma, first-hand, when my mother was diagnosed with cancer.

In efforts to gain insight on how racial bias impact opinions toward race in healthcare, three surveys will be distributed to three different populations -- black people, white people, and healthcare officials. My results aligned with my hypothesis: The differing populations do affect the outcome of the surveys. This study serves to provide the public with resources to acknowledge their own implicit bias, and push society one more step toward closing the gap in black and white patient mortality rates.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Such an important topic!  Thank you for doing this work. Mrs. Wexler
Such an important research topic, your research is amazing.
Nice project! Very good idea to research on.
I really enjoyed reading about your project.  Racial bias is sadly extremely common in healthcare are is an important and relevant topic, especially considering cases such as Henrietta Lacks.
Good job.  I had a longer comment and hope it got sent.
Very clearly laid-out presentation.
