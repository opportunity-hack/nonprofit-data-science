The Effect of Temperature on the Bounce of a Tennis Ball
Physics, Astronomy, and Mathematics

Ethan Gutierrez
Grade:
8

Teacher:
MariAnn Slater

What is your project about ( purpose )
 In this experiment, I am trying to determine which temperature is best for the bounce of a  tennis ball, a low or high temperature. 

Why did you choose this project? 

I chose this project because I am a tennis player and I play tennis in different temperatures, so I would like to learn if the temperature has to do with the bounce of the tennis ball.

What was your overall/ result conclusion?

My overall conclusion was that the heated balls had a higher average bounce than the cold balls.

 Why is your project important?

My project is important because this would help other tennis players learn that if you are playing in a cold or hot temperature, you should adjust the way you move because the tennis ball would react differently.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
