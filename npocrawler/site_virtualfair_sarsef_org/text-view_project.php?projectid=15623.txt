1) My project looked at whether an eco-friendly choice for coffee and hot chocolate Keurig drinks produces the same quality drink as a standard plastic K-cup, and how willing would subjects be to switch from using a plastic pod to an eco-friendly choice. 
2) I chose this project because plastic k-cups are hard to recycle and are harmful to the environment. 
3) I found that reusable pods provide similar temperature, PH, concentration, and tastes as plastic pods and that subjects were more likely to switch to an eco-friendly choice for Keurigs. 
4) It's important to know that reusable pods are a good alternative, and that increasing awareness about eco-friendly choices could help our earth.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

I like how you used science to try to influence others to make better choices for our planet.
Your experiment, on this very important topic, was well thought out and organized.  Excellent job!
