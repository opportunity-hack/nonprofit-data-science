Are Men or Women Smarter?
Behavioral and Social Sciences

Abram F. Bailey-Werbel
Grade:
5

Teacher:
Nancy Ingerson

1. My project is to determine whether men or women are smarter. 2. I chose this project because all of my life I always wanted to know who is smarter. 3. My conclusion is that they are equally smart. 4 .My project is important because it answered the long unanswered question of who is smarter!
This project has been cleared by SRC.


Comments

Are there any big studies on this? Interesting question!
I like how you solved the age difference by taking a larger sample over many age groups. But, if age does matter, how might you look for it? Would another test method possibly show the age affect?
