In this experiment, I will be testing different opening sizes on a solar oven to figure out how it affects the temperature within it. The purpose of this experiment is to see if the size of the opening impacts the temperature within the size the solar oven. I became interested in this experiment when I learned about solar ovens in environmental design, and how they can be used to save the planet. The information gained through this experiment will help scientists understand if sizes in openings matter on a solar oven. It will also help poor countries because the people will be able to know how to make the most efficient design of a solar oven.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
