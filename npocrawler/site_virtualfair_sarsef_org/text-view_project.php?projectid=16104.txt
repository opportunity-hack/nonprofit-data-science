My project is about testing the behavior of my pets when my dad plays his trumpet. I will test them in different environments and activities. I enjoy observing my animals. My dogs have adapted to the music in the environment because my dad is a musician, but my cat continues not to like it. This project shows how animals can adapt to environments.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

I love how chill your pitbull was :D. Interesting that the cat was more affected
