Can Natural Materials Remove  Impurities From Unprocessed Irrigation Water?
Earth and Environmental Science

Lucas Freeman
Grade:
7

Teacher:
MariAnn Slater

1. In this experiment I am trying to determine if charcoal, fired clay, or sand can remove impurities from unprocessed irrigation water, and which is more effective.
2. The reason that I chose this project is because in some rural places
getting purified water can be very difficult.
3. The results showed that charcoal was the best substance followed by fired clay then sand.
4. My project is important because it can help people who are in rural places to somewhat be able to purify their water.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
