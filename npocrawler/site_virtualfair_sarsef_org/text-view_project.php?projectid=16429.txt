Teacher:
Ms. Oliver

What puts the pop in a popover? Why does it rise? We eat popovers a lot. Sometimes they rise very high and sometimes not at all. Popovers use steam to rise, not yeast. They don’t rise much higher if the ingredients are heated first. It attempts to answer one of the greatest mysteries in cooking! Key words: Kitchen chemistry, steam, popovers
This project has been cleared by SRC.
