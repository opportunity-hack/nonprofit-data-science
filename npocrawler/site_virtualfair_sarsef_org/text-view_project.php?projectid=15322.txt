My Project is about which colors can be the most harmful to your eyes and if there’s a correspondence between the cone cells fatigue and the time of cone cells stimulation. When I was looking for a project, I saw this experiment called “Are Your Eyes Playing Tricks on You?” (www.sciencebuddies.org). It reminded me how my parents used to tell me “Rest your eyes, or you might damage them and become blind”, so I was interested to see how afterimages work and to learn how eyes perceive color. According to my results the longer you stare at the image (cone stimulation), the longer the afterimage will stay and that the color blue is the most harmful. It’s important to understand how your eyes work and how they can become fatigue or damage because it’s necessary to stay healthy and take care of your eyes. Since everything (from school to work) is online these days.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
