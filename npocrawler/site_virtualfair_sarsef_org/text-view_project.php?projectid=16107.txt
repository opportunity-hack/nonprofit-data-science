Eggshells As Climate Intervention
Earth and Environmental Science

Joseph Russell-Goodman
Grade:
8

Teacher:
Ivan D Yocum

My project is about ocean acidification and using eggshells as a potential mitigating process and material.

 I choose this project because I hypothesize that ocean
acidification is a major issue in today’s oceans with serious ramifications for marine food webs.

 My project concluded that crushed eggshells are effective means of raising the pH of water in a laboratory setting. Now the logistics and cost of crushing up enough eggshells and then distributing them over the global ocean, and how marine animals will
react to the eggshells is not something I could have tested.

 My project is important because it addresses a serious global issue that could be addressed with readily abundant materials that currently have no use and are disposed of.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
