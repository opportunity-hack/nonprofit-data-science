Grade:

Teacher:
Fred Roberts

California poppies were planted in four different types of soil, one with worms, one with ash from the Bighorn fire, one with Miracle Gro, and one being the control.  My project was important to demonstrate if natural fertilizers are better than commercial fertilizers.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
