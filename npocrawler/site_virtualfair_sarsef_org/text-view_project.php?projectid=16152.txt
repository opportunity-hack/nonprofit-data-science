As mass increases, does velocity increase or decrease? I am sending a mini skateboard down a ramp 3 different times, each time with a different amount of mass. From there I will record the descent time to find the average velocity. Why I chose the project- When I was little, my friend, her little sister and I were racing hot wheels down my ramp. We decided to each pick a car and see who won. My friend and I picked the two best racing cars I had, they were small, sharp, aerodynamic , and literally made for racing. Then when my friend's little sister chose her car, she chose an ice cream truck. The ice cream truck was this big, clunky car that never got used (because I thought it wasn't good for racing). I knew I had the race in the bag, but low and behold the ice cream truck passed the finish line a good 3 seconds before the others. My mom explained to my friend and I that the ice cream truck won because it was heavier than the other cars. I wanted to create a similar "experiment" by learning how mass affects velocity. Results- After conducting my experiment I have concluded that with constant force, as mass increases velocity decreases. Why this is important- Keywords- Mass, Velocity, Skateboard, Force
