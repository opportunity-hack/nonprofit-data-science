1. My project is about which SPF rated sunscreens is the best. 
2. I chose this project because I was interested to learn about sunburns and skin cancer.
3. My conclusion was that even if your sunscreen is not 100 SPF it's better to wear sunscreen than none at all
4. My project is important because it shows that lower SPF rated sunscreen still provide a good amount of protection.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

This is a great question for Arizona!
I liked your conclusion and that you had a cloudy day to test too!  that means we need to wear sunscreen ALL the time when we go outside.  Good job!
