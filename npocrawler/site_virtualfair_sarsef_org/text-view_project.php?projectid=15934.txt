Growing Mediums and Their Effects on Plant Growth
Animal and Plant Science

Grade:

Hailey Sanders

My project tests different growing mediums for how they affect growth on plants; I tested soil, soil with fertilizer, LECA, and hydroponics. I chose this project because I enjoy plant science and I was curious to see if they were better ways to produce more food. My findings found that Soil with fertilizer and LECA produced better results than soil, and hydroponics produced way more growth than anything else. Since growing mediums can affect plant growth by a lot, using and testing new mediums could lead to being better able to produce food which can help with world hunger.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
