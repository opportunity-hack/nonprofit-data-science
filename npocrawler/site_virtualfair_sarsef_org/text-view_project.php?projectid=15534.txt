Scientists see microgreens as a functional food, which means that they can provide key nutrients in a practical way.  Some people even call them super foods.  The world is always looking for ways to provide healthy foods for everyone.  This class wanted to show how easy it was to grow a salad indoors.
This project has been cleared by SRC.


Comments

Nice job! Nice trying to eat healthier and liked notes about siblings and pets causing problems.
I learned a lot from your project and now want to grow my own microgreens! I especially thought your Procedure section was well-written and detailed. Great job on this project!
