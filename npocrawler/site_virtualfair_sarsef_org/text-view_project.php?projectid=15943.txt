Placement of a Solar Box Oven
Energy and Environmental Engineering

Grade:
7

Teacher:
Adelle McNiece

In this experiment I will be testing to see if the placement affects the temperature inside the solar oven. The purpose of this experiment is to see if it matters where you put a solar oven when you are going to cook something. I became interested in this experiment when we began learning about solar ovens in class. This experiment will help people know if the placing of a solar oven matters.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
