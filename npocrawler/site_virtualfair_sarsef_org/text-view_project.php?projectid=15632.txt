1) My project is about finding the best DISINFECTING wipes, to disinfect multiple surfaces. 
2) I chose this project because as of the past year, COVID-19 was been raining, lives, families, and the economy. People need to be safe to choose the best wipes. 
3) My overall conclusion is that Clorox wipes work the best on multiple surfaces. 
4) My project is important so that stores and people in general know the best wipe to disinfect surfaces.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
