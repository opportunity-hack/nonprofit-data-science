Do students read better with colored backgrounds/paper or on white backgrounds/paper. I am doing this project because I have Irlen Syndrome.  It is a  perceptual processing disorder which affects reading. I see blurry words and the words move when on white paper.  Colored overlays help me see printed words clearly, stable, easy to see and comfortable. My experiment is about using colored backgrounds on our remote assignments to see how students reading  may be improved.
This project has been cleared by SRC.


Comments

Interesting results- your project made me think!
Very creative!  I love how you used our current learning environment and the students in your class to conduct a research project that may have a positive impact on people with Irlen syndrome.
Interesting study! I never expected to essentially understand that this was the case!
