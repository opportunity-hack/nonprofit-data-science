PendingHey everyone so our project is basically blowing up a balloon with the fizz of candy and soda combined. In other words, we got a funnel and attached a balloon onto the bottom. Then, we filled the balloon with all different types of candy.  I used pop rocks, sour patch kids, and nerds and Sophia used skittles, nerds, and pop rocks. We chose these candies because they make a bigger outcome and effect toward making fizz. The pop rocks have these little bubbles of trapped carbon dioxide inside of them which causes them to have this little chemical release to the soda. Making it fizz a lot more than other candies. Next, after we poured the candy into the balloon we then attached it to the top of the soda bottle. Then, we flipped the balloon up and let all the candy fall into the soda. Causing the reaction of the candy and soda to make fizz. As a result, the fizz blew up the balloon to about 5-6 inches.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

I love that you used displacement to measure the gas expansion.
