My project is about the individual roles in baking. I chose this project because I am interested in science and baking. My overall conclusion was that each and every of the individual ingredients are vital for the outcome to be edible and enjoyable. Removing any one of the ingredients makes the end result less enjoyable for various reasons. I can also confidently conclude that chocolate chip cookies, when baked properly, are delicious. My project was important for me to learn more interesting things in science.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
