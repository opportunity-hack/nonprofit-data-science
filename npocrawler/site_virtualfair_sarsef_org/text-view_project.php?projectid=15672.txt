My project tests different types of cups to see which one keeps water the coldest. I chose this project because my water bottle keeps my water super cold, and I was curious to see if other types of material kept water just as cold. I found that metal kept water the coolest temperature. This is important because we live in a warm climate, and it is good to know what type of cup will keep our water cool.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
