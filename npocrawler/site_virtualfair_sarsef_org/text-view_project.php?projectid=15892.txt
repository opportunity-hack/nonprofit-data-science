My project’s main idea was to test if Virtual Reality games can relieve stress.  An Oculus Quest 2 Virtual Reality gaming system was used to test my hypothesis. I wanted this to be my project because Virtual Reality  can feel very real and also can assist people in feeling happy. Two special tools were used to help me collect test results. One tool measured heart rate and oxygen (O2) rate and the other tested the participant’s feelings. My results were a little surprising but were mostly what I expected. I expected that the calm games would relieve stress and that was found to be true. What was unexpected was that all games tested had a great improvement on feelings of sadness.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
