1. My project is about copper plating different metals.
2. I chose this project because it was the most interesting to me.
3. My overall conclusion was that not all metals can attract copper.
4. My project is very important because copper plating offers a variety of benefits due to its malleability, conductivity, corrosion resistance, lubricious resistance, and anti-bacterial qualities.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
