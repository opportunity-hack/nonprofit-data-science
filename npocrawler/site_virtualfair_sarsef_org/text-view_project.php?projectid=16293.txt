1. My project is about candy because l like candy and I wanted to do something that involved my taste buds. 

2. The reason I choose this project was because l wondered if all the Skittles tasted the same or if they tasted different based on their color.  

3. My overall conclusion is that most people could not correctly guess the color of the Skittle on most colors.  

4. My project is important because it will let people know that if you have excellent tasting you can tell the flavors apart.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
