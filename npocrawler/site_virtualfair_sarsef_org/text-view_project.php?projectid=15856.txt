Melvin Williams, Jr.

The purpose of this experiment is to test if the type of recyclable material affects the temperature of a wooden house. I became interested in this experiment when my mother mentioned that engineers have used different kinds of recyclable material to serve as insulation in houses. The information gained through this experiment will either prove or disprove if recyclable materials are effective materials to use as insulation.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
