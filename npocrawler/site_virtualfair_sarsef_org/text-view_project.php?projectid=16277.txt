Rust is an annoying problem and in some instances can be fatal. If something becomes rusty, the rust must be removed or the rusted object might be completely destroyed. In reaction to this problem, the researcher tested which chemicals would work best at removing rust. The researcher compared undiluted white vinegar, diluted laundry detergent, water and the commercial product Rust-Oleum Rust-Remover. Rusty bolts were submerged in the various liquids and timed. The Rust-Oleum was the quickest but the vinegar was effective as well. The water and the soap were both slow and only removed a small amount of rust.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
