The Intubation Shield is placed over a patient’s head and shoulders before placement of the breathing tube.  Holes in the box allow for a clinician’s hands to perform breathing tube placement.  The plexiglass barrier protects the clinician from viral droplets generated during intubation.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
