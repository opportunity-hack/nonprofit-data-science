What Metals are the Most Resistant to Corrosion
Chemical Science

Elias Erroa, Zachary Wortman
Grade:
8

Teacher:
David Ficke

Our project was about finding what metal is most resistant to corrosion. We put several different metals in water, and tested to see which one corroded the most slowly.  I chose this project because it seemed simple and straightforward, and I wanted to learn more about corrosion and metals.  Our conclusion was that the zinc-coated steel metal was the most resistant to corrosion. Our project is important because the information that we gained from the project can be used by people that make metal projects. If companies that work with metals gained access to this information, they could start making their products out of metals that are resistant to corrosion.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
