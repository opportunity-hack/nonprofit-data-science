-Ever since I was a baby I have had sleep difficulties,  I find it hard to function the next day and its hard to break the bad sleep cycle.   I chose to do a sleep study using natural remedies to find what helps me fall asleep faster. Four natural remedies tested over four weeks. Warm Almond milk before bed, yoga/Qi Gong stretching before bed, visualizing and counting sheep to 100 and lavender essential oil with a 4-7-8 breathing technique. Yoga/Qi Gong stretching was the most effective at reducing the amount of time it took to fall asleep and also helped me sleep for the longest amount of time.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

I love that your science project was aimed to help you sleep better and that you found something to help you.  Very methodical approach.
I admire how you examined a question/problem that is relevant and important to your life. Also, great idea to interview your doctor!
