When baking brownies, there are many types of baking pans to choose from including the type of material such as aluminum foil, glass, and different colors of metal. This project was to determine which baking pan material will bake the brownies the best in 34 minutes at 350? in a conventional oven.  The  hypothesis is that if the darker colored metal pan is used, then the brownies will be most baked and thicker than brownies from the others pan materials. The darker the pan color, the more heat energy is absorbed.  This is similar to  wearing a black shirt on a sunny day. The energy from the sun is absorbed by the dark shirt. Five different types of pans were used to bake brownies.  Each trial included measuring the thickness of the brownies and the moisture on inserted 
toothpicks.  Based upon the results of both trials, the dark metal pan did 
the best job transferring heat energy to the brownie mix to bake the 
brownies.  The brownies in the dark metal pan were the thickest and it 
was the only pan that had one toothpick that was moist in each trial.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
