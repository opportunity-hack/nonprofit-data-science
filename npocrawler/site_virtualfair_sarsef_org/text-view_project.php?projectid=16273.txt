My project is about seeing which type of artificial lights works best for growing food indoors. i chose this because in the pandemic lots of people have to stay indoors. My results were that Incandescent had the highest plants, LED daylight had the most sprouts, but LED lights were the healthiest. It is important because some people have no access to sun.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
