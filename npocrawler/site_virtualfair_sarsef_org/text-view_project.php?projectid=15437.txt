The Cleanest Bike Route in Town.

In my project, I research which bike route in Tucson has the cleanest air. I test the air quality of bike routes in different parts of town by driving near them with the particulate trap I made. I used vaseline, grid paper, and tape to make the trap. Because the particulates are not always visible to the eye, I examine the trap under a microscope and count the number of particulates captured. My results show the bike routes near Interstate-10 had the most particulates. The bike routes along River Road and Mountain Avenue had the least number of particulates. So, cyclists, like me, who want to breathe fewer air particulates, should cycle in central Tucson.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Great job combining an interest of yours with a scientific examination! There were definitely some surprises here. Would be great to continue this research, maybe redoing the tests in different weathe
