How Does Bike Suspension Work?

My project is about how bike suspension works. I chose this project because I was interested in how the suspension that I use works. My overall conclusion was that adjusting the suspension does noticeably affect how the bike performs. My project is important because people would want to know if they wanted to buy an expensive bike fork or not.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
