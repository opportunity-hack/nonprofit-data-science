1. My project is about freezing seeds, heating seeds, and keeping normal temperature seeds, planting them and seeing which one grew faster and how they grew.
2. Even though we had limited options this year for our science projects, I chose this project because I wanted to see how different temperatures could affect growth on plants.
3. My results were: the regular plants grew the most and the frozen grew more than than the heated ones. The heated ones didn't grow at all. The frozen seeds grew oddly throughout the experiment. I learned that different temperatures did affect plant growth in various ways.
4. My project is important because it's pertinent to today's climate issues, and it can show us how adverse weather conditions affect our world and how we live.
Keywords: Climate issues/adverse weather, Plant growth, freezing, heating.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Fun Project, I know people who keep their seeds in the freezer. Now I'm going to encourage them to try this to show them it may not really be helping :) Thanks, well done
