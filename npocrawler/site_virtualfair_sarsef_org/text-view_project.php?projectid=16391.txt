How Do Pets Affect Our Health?
Behavioral and Social Sciences

Jennifer DeBenedetti Class
Grade:
5

Teacher:
Jennifer DeBenedetti

A love for our pets is where this whole idea started!  Students wondered how those of us with pets vs. without pets might be coping differently through remote learning.  They researched different measures of health (sleep, stress levels, blood pressure, cholesterol, etc.) and the effects pets have on these measures.  Then they created a survey for MS students and sorted responses based on the independent variable of who owned a pet or not.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
