HS-BE027
How the Position of Sleep Affects the Quality of Sleep Achieved
Behavioral and Social Science

Grade:
HS

1. My project is about different sleeping positions and the effect they have on the quality of sleep received. 
2. I chose this project because of the lack of sleep most high school students get, I wanted to see if different sleeping positions would make the quality of sleep differ. 
3. My overall result demonstrated that people who slept on their back achieved a higher quality of sleep. 
4. My project is important because of the lack of sleep people are getting in modern time, this data could help people sleep in different positions to receive a higher quality of sleep.
This project has been cleared by SRC.


Comments

I don't sleep, I slept at 5AM most times, but this helps me to remember to sleep early. - Venkata Manikonda
Interesting, less time asleep can still equate to better quality of sleep if I sleep on my back. This is great information to know. (especially for naps)
Thank you, well done.
