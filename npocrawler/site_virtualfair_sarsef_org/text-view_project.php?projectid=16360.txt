Fingerprints: Unique or Mystique?
Animal and Plant Sciences

Anna Perez Chumakova, Isabel Smith
Grade:

Jennine Grogan

The project is about finding out whether fingerprints are genetically inherited from parents, or not. We chose the project to learn more about fingerprints, inheritance and DNA, and have fun as we learn. Our results demonstrated that our initial hypothesis that fingerprints of related people will be similar proved to be somewhat correct. Our project is important because it gives us and our classmates the opportunity to learn about fingerprints, and DNA of related people and families.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Really good to recognize that if you could have had more people to test you might have had different results. Getting a good sample size is always important in reserach
I loved your trivia at the end. I really learned things. I didn't realize I had so much in common with a cabbage.
It's interesting that you had the rare Arch pattern in your group. I wonder if the Arch pattern is more dominant in that particular family.
