I am going to investigate how blood flows around your body. I think when you exercise your blood pressure will get higher and the oxygen
will get lower, because my heart beats faster and I breath harder when I jump around. I learned that our heart works harder when we exercise and works less hard when we rest. Our hearts do a good job of keeping oxygen levels high in our bodies if we are healthy.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Nice work! 
Do you think you would get the same results if you tested a man? What if you tested 10 men and 10 women?
Nice job collecting and displaying your data!
