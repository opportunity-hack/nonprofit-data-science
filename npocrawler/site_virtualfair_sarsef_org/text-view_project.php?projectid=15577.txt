Mr. Greg Gaines

My project is about making a sleeping bag using Amazon bags. I chose this project because if I hadn't we would have thrown away the dangerous plastic bags. My conclusion was my first bag was better overall in heat, comfort, and ease to get into. My project is important because I can hand out the bags to homeless people so that they can stay warm.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
