Temperature Controlled Bassinet
Engineering, Robotics, and Computer Science

Grade:
8

Teacher:
Lindsey Oswald

The project is a temperature controlled bassinet. The reason this project was chosen was because the researcher has a baby sister and he does not want her to overheat or get to cold at night. The project ended up working but it was a prototype it did heat up the box (bassinet). The researcher felt as though the project was important was because of his baby sister. That is what inspired him to do this project.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
