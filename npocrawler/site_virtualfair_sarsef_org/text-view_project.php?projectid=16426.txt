My project is to engineer a fan powered hovercraft. I chose this project because I have been learning about laws of motion and wanted to find an alternative form of transportation to gas powered vehicles. My result was that I was able to make a craft that hovers by fan power. I will need to keep working on my design in order to add controls and directional movement. My project is important because it shows people that there are other forms of movement and hopefully that can lead to less pollution.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
