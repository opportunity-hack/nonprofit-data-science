My project looked for germs on the surface of personal protective equipment (PPE). I chose this project because I saw a man wearing a very dirty mask at the store one day. The conclusion of my project is that PPE which is believed to protect us from COVID-19 can also have germs that could make us sick. This project helps guide people on how to stay healthy while protect ourselves from COVID-19.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
