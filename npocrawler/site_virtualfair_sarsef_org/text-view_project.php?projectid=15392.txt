The Effects of Industrial Hemp Fabric on the Water Consumption of an Article of Clothing When Compared to Cotton
Earth and Environmental Science

1. My project is about the water footprint of a single piece of clothing and how it is affected by the type of fabric used. 
2. I chose this project because I am very interested in the environmental impact of fashion; namely, how supposedly sustainable fabrics, such as cotton and hemp, compare to each other, and whether they actually are sustainable. This is so I, and hopefully, other consumers can begin to make the best possible choices for the environment as fashion is one of the biggest polluters in the world.
3. In conclusion, I found that one hemp t-shirt used about one-fourth of the water it takes to make one cotton t-shirt.
4. This project is important because there is a lack of research on the smaller scale of fashion's impact on the environment, and I believe this is the most important type of research because it gives consumers a way to directly relate their choices to an impact. Through my project, they are able to see the difference a single t-shirt can make when it comes to the impact one person can have on our environment.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
