Which Box Will Slide Down First?
Physics, Astronomy, and Mathematics

Grade:

Ms. Wright

In my experiment, I took a box with three different surfaces on the bottom and checked to see at what angle each box slid down a ramp. I chose this experiment because I thought it was interesting. My results showed that the regular box slid down the ramp at the smallest angle and the sandpaper box slid down the ramp at the biggest angle. This project is important because it tests the power of friction.
This project has been cleared by SRC.


Comments

Your experiment was well designed and analyzed.  Great job thinking about the material of the box and how that might influence your results and future experimentation.
