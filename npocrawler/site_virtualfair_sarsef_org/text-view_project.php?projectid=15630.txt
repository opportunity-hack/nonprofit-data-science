My project is about putting apples in certain containers and seeing which ones oxidized the fastest. I chose this project because in class, we had learned about oxidation, so I wanted to try it out for myself. The Tupperware and resealable plastic bag keep oxidation out the longest. This project is important because then grocery stores will know a way to keep their apples white, and so that will get more customers!
This project has been cleared by SRC.
