Calling all Arizonans! The problem I had was that it is always so hot to play outside in the Arizona summer. I wanted to find a way to keep cool wherever I go. My idea was to create a hat that keeps you protected from the sun, cools you off, has a drinking water supply and a misting system. A similar product existed called Cool Comfort Cooling Hats. These hats have water inside the top, but it only keeps you cool on your head. I added: a water hose for drinking, misters and a sunscreen holder. The hardest part to create was the mister. I needed something that could hold a lot of water so the mister could spray for a long period of time. I used a large water bottle, but it would be better if the water source came from the hat instead of having to carry around a water bottle.

Awesome Job!  idea was to create a hat that keeps you protected from the sun, cools you off, has a drinking water supply and a misting system.
that idea was really well done and implemented into this project as a major success
A great invention - your adjustments were thoughtful and very smart. Way to go on this!
