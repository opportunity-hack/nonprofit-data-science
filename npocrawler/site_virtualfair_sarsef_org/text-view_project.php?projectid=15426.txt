The Sound Of Classical Music

Grade:

1. My project is about testing what form of sound my pet responds to in classical music based on duration, pitch and loudness that defines melody.
2. I chose this project because my pet enjoys classical music. I wanted to explore what makes Flash respond to melodies differently.
3. My overall conclusion was that Flash was calm when I played long, continuous notes. Also, his heart rate matched the tempo of the music. This is melody to his ears!
4. My project is important because pets can get anxious just like us, and sometimes go crazy just like us!! This method helps us find a solution to calming their anxiety.

Comments

Great job by not only having the different classical music but also being able to identify the
Good job identifying the notes that make each piece of music different. You can clearly say that each is unique.
I like how you used the heart rate to measure "calmness". Great to have something measurable, not just observations
