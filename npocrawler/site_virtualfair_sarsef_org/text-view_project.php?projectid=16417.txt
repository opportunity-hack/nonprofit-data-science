This project explores the mind and specifically, one's reaction time. We chose this project because we are really into videogames and thought it would be nice to know someones general reaction time based off of certain activities they participate in. We found that people who play over five hours of video games a week have a slightly faster reaction time then people who play under five hours of video games a week. This project can help determine someone’s reaction time by looking at age and what activities they partake in.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
