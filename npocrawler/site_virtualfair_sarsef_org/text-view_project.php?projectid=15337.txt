Trees are vital as they give us oxygen, store carbon, stabilize the soil, give life to the world’s wildlife, and provide us with materials for tools and shelter. Trees can also cool the air by shading and releasing water into the atmosphere from their leaves, known as transpiration cooling. Will more trees provide cooler temperatures? My results showed that more trees did not provide cooler temperatures, but one tree versus no tree did provide a cooler temperature. As global warming becomes a concern, it is important to learn if the number of trees in an area can help provide cooler temperatures.
This project has been cleared by SRC.


Comments

I like how your results made you think of more questions and variables. More science needs to be done!
This is a very important topic for those of us living in the desert.  Thank you for creating and presenting this experiment. Good job!
