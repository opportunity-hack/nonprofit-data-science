What Is the Effect of Video Games on Heart Rate?
Behavioral and Social Sciences

Maya Horowitz, Emma Palumbo
Grade:
4

Teacher:
Tara Wieber

We wanted to measure heart rate changes due to video games because your heart rate is a vital sign. We chose this project because we like video games, but want to stay healthy. We found that one game raised everyone's heart rate, but not all games did. This project is important because a lot of people play video games, so their health may be affected.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
