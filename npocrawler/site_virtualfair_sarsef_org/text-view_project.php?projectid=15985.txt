Vanessa Schiess Class
Grade:
K

Teacher:
Vanessa Schiess

A City of Tucson Water educational film taught these learners that water scarcity is a problem in the desert, as habitants of the desert, our young engineers worked on developing playscapes that would be fun to play on and also harvest rainwater. 

This project was selected to provide students with hands-on, real-life learning that met math, science and writing standards and also allowed students to step away from a computer screen during remote learning. 

We concluded that nature had all our answers, prototypes that contained pleats, slants, and were water resistant collect the most water in cisterns, much like that animals and plants of the desert that students learned about through a biomimicry virtual field trip to the Sonoran Desert Museum. 

This project is important because taught the next generation of engineers about biomimicry and how we can look at nature to help solve human problems.
This project has been cleared by SRC.


Comments

I love your drawings and models. Great ideas and useful in an area with so little rain.
Very creative, I like the different prototypes models
So proud of these young engineers. Your research, note-taking and prototype-refine process shows the thinking of true scientists.
