My project is about seeing if someone can change a plant's color by watering it with colored water. I choose this project because I love plants and was wondering if I could see how well they can filter out liquids other than water. My results were that the flower did not turn blue when it was watered with blue water, but the cut flower did turn blue. My project is important because it can show people how well roots can filtrate.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Wow. How amazing a plant is. That it can filter out things it doesn't need, that's amazing.
