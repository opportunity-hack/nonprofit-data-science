Breathe Better in Your Mask
Health and Wellness

Mrs. Opela

My project tests the breathability of different types of face masks: N95s, surgical grade paper masks and cloth masks. I chose this project because I wanted to do something unique to 2020 and face masks have become a part of our lives, yet there wasn’t much information available on which ones were more comfortable to wear. My project found that the cloth masks had the most airflow, followed by the surgical grade paper masks. The N95 mask had little to no air flow. This project is important because it helps show which mask has the most airflow and therefore which type is more comfortable to wear.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Great job. I will be sticking with cloth masks anytime I am doing activity such as exercise, if not everyday. Thanks :)
