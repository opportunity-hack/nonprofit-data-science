Alexandria Vaughn

What is your project about?

My project is about how palm oil in oreos affects orangutans lives.


Why did you choose this project?

I chose this project because I went to a zoo in California and I learned that orangutans' habitats are getting destroyed due to palm oil and I love orangutans.

What was your result/overall conclusion?

My result and overall conclusion is that Oreos can still taste good without palm oil.

Why is your project important?

People should care about this project because thousands of animals’ habitats are getting destroyed and replaced with palm oil farms. Because of this, many animals are dying, for example orangutans, just because us humans keep eating Oreos, Ritz crackers, ex. If Oreos no longer include palm oil, it could make a huge impact on the world and save lots of animals’ lives!
This project has been cleared by SRC.
