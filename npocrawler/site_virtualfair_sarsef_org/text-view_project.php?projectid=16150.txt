HS-PS017
Effect of Fertilizer Concentration on Pansy Growth
Plant Science

Emily Felchlia
Grade:
HS

Teacher:
Michael Frank, PhD

My project is about how the concentration of fertilizer affects plants. I chose this project because I heard of a similar experiment that had results that contradict what fertilizer is supposed to do. My overall conclusion is that fertilizer doesn’t always have the same effect on all plants. This knowledge could be applicable to various food crops or just to the average public.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
