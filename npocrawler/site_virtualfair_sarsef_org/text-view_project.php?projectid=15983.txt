HS-BE030
Sound Production: The Relationship Between Sound and Productivity
Behavioral and Social Science

Jack Miles
Grade:
HS

Teacher:
Elyse Wexler

This project studies the relationship between sounds present in a place of work and the productivity of humans in those work places. I chose this project after experiencing personal issues with hearing different sounds while working. I found that experiences I have had with being productive and hearing different sounds were quite similar to most participants in my project. This project is important as it could provide information that schools and businesses could use to improve the productivity and concentration of students and workers, therefore improving schools and businesses as a whole.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
