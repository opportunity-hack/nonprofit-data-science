I am going to use different light colors to see how long it takes for your eyes to adjust to the dark using red, blue, green and white light.
This project has been cleared by SRC.


Comments

Very well designed experiment. It's good to look for improvements, but trust your data and see if you can understand why red light allows faster adjusting.
Well designed experiment. Trust what your data tells you. Research why red light allows faster adjusting to low light. Maybe it's telling you something about human eyes. What about animal's eyes?
