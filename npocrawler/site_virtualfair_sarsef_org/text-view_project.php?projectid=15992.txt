HS-PM009
The Effects Mask Efficiency Has on the Parachute Capabilities of Face Masks
Physics, Astronomy, and Mathematics

Grade:
HS

Teacher:
Elyse Wexler

1. My project researches how well masks work when used as parachutes.
2. I wanted to research the effects of air restriction and shape of parachute affected the efficiency of a face mask as a parachute.
3. Face masks that restrict air flow more strictly than others, were stronger parachutes than face masks that allowed air to flow more freely through them.
4. It could help determine key factors in how parachutes operate and what makes parachutes efficient.

This project has been cleared by SRC.
