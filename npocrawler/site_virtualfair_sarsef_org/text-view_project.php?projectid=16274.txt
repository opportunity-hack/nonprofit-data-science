Key words: sourdough, starter, rise, flour
I want to determine if the type of flour affects the rise of a sourdough starter. I came up with the idea for my project because of my mom’s sourdough starter. I wondered how my mom made the starter rise. The purpose of my project is to find out which types of flour make the yeast rise the most. The all purpose had the highest average rise at 21 hrs (20.6 mm), while the whole wheat samples rose the most over the initial seven hour period (12.6 mm). The mesquite had the lowest average rise at both time points (7 hr: 2.6 mm; 21 hr: 8 mm). In conclusion, the type of flour had an affect on the rise of the sourdough starter.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Great project. I wondered about gluten free rice flour.
Great connection to your home life - and I love a project that yields delicious results!
