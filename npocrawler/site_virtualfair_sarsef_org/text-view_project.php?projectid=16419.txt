Grade:

Teacher:
MariAnn Slater

1.The purpose of my project is to figure out if the 5 second rule is truly a factor.
2. I chose this project because I am interested in bacterial growth. 
3. The result of my experiment were both petri dishes were really similar . The 5 second petri dish was really close to the 50 second
petri dish.
4. My project is important because it helps understand bacteria growth.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
