Most of us are born with hardwired reflexes which should be found in the spinal cord but sometimes they can be found in the center of your brain your brain can modify your body's
reaction time like when you are falling it your body's automatic responds to extend your arms and hands to catch the fall and decrease the amount of damage.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
