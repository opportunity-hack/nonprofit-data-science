I chose this project because I like to exercise. 
I would like to know what your heart rate means when doing different exercise
Would your heart rate change more or less depend on the exercise  
For instance  yoga, running, jumping jacks 
It will impact people who  like to exercise
It will help you know what your heart rate is 
I created a model of a heart and lungs to see how they work and then this experiment let me visualize what was happening while I was doing the workout.

Good job! I like that you had a couple of subjects (people), and that you had them do 3 trials to see if you get the same results in the same person and in different people.
Great project! You chose a real question that you had to answer. Very well done. I like your model too.
Great job! Your video demonstration was a really great addition to your project. Way to go. Your hard work paid off - I learned a lot.
