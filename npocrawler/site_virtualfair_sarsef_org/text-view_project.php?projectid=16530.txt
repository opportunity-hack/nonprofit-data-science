Home made soap vs Store-bought soap
Chemical Science

Grade:

Teacher:
Joel Barrington

The purpose of this project is to discover if our homemade soap is better than store-bought soap
and to show how some of the ingredients in store-bought soap are bad for you. We did this
experiment because one of our group members was talking about soap at the time and we thought
it would be a good idea to make it for fun and use it as a science project. In the end, all the
components of the store-bought soap outperformed the homemade soap in cleaning. By
conducting this investigation however, we are more confident in arguing that homemade cleaners
offer a healthy option for your skin and other materials.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
