Sustainability of a Tucson Aquatic Habitat

This project is about finding whether a pond in Tucson will be sustainable for the next 15 years. I chose this project because ponds in Tucson use a lot of water and I wonder if it can be sustained. My result is that it can be sustained but it would still be good to reduce the surface area to reduce water loss. This project is important because water is scarce but it also provides for wildlife.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Great job! Thank you for involving the homeowners association board in your project - they're the ones who can enact the changes you propose. Keep up the good work!
