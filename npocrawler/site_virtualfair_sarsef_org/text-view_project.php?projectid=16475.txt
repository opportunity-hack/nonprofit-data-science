Health and Wellness

1. In this experiment I will test which coffee increases your heart rate the most?Too much
caffeine can increase your heart rate which may not pump enough blood to the rest of
your body. This is dangerous because this could starve your organs and tissues of
oxygen and can cause tachycardia. Therefore this experiment would help determine
which coffee brand increases your heart rate the most and which could be potentially the
best for you.
2. I chose this project because I like coffee and I wanted to find out which coffee gives you
more energy
3. My average results for Maxwell House, House blend is an increase of 2.6. The average
for McCafe Premium roast is an increase of 4.1. The average for starbuck holiday blend
is an increase of 0.1
4. Too much caffeine can increase your heart rate which may not pump enough blood to

potentially the best for you.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
