My project is what sugar in root beer makes the most carbonation. I chose this project because I love root beer and wanted to know more about the bubbles. Brown sugar produced the most carbonation.  To know which sugars make the most carbonation and how it affects the root beer.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

What a fun idea for a project! I love root beer, too. You got to do science and drink root beer.
