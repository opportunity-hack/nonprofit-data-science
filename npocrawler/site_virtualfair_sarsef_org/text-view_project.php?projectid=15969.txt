In this experiment, I will be testing different sizes of paper rocket to figure out how it affects  how far the rocket will go. The purpose of this experiment is to see if size will make a difference in distance traveled. I became interested in this experiment when I saw a video about how to make a simple rocket. The information gained through this experiment will help people like mechanical engineers  if they make rockets and know if different sizes will make them go farther. 
This project has been cleared by SRC.
