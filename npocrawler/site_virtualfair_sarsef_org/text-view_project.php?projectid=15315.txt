This project had the goal of identifying possible risk factors for developing asthma through a survey analyzing maternal parents’ and their children’s health, race, ethnic, and activity backgrounds in order to help prevent the disease and improve treatment plans. Asthma is largely prevalent among all age groups, yet there is no certain explanation regarding when or how the disease is developed. It was hypothesized that maternal asthma and respiratory conditions, birth by Caesarean section, low exercise habits during pregnancy, and non-Hispanic ethnicity would increase the probability of a child developing asthma. Key words: asthma, respiratory conditions, allergies, activity level, ethnicity, survey
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Amazing! I love your slide deck presentation. Your research topic is so interesting as well!
Good work! Getting people to volunteer for a survey is harder than one would expect. Good job analyzing the data you had. I'd love to see what you could do with a larger cohort.
