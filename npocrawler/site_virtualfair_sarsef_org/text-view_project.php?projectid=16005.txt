I have conducted many different experiments to get to one final answer. Does elephant's toothpaste, or Coca-Cola with Mentos Propel an object better. I've conducted 4 different experiments. I chose this project because I've been seeing it a lot more lately on YouTube. We find the conclusion that elephant's toothpaste (Coca-Cola with dish soap and mentos) works better than Coca-Cola with Mentos. I think with this information people will start to use elephant's toothpaste if they want to do an experiment related to this one.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
