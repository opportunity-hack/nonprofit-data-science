The Effects of Color and Darkness on Thoughts and Feelings
Behavioral and Social Sciences

I was wondering if light affects our mood? Are we happier in a light colored room and sadder in a dark colored room? I chose this project because there is a trend right now to have light strips in our bedrooms and if light can help determine our moods, we would be able to choose a color which could make us happier. Based on my experiment, my hypothesis was correct. The color of lights, over a prolonged period of time, can change the way you feel, your mood, and even your heart rate. When I first started my experiment I was not sure how the results would turn out. It wasn’t until after I read the results side by side that I noticed the differences and the similarities. This project is important because our mood effects how we feel and knowing how to change our mood helps us in all aspects of life.

You found some very patient people to sit still that long!
I thought your project idea was really cool! I liked how the colors you used actually made it feel like the emotions, if emotions were colors.
