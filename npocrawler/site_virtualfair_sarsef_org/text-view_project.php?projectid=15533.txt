The Power of Pulleys

Mrs. Middendorf

My project is about how to raise things into my tree the easiest way. I chose my project because I wanted to be able to lift heavy things up into my tree. I learned that a block and tackle pulley system worked best for me. I was important to me so I could use the pulley when I play in my tree.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Great job. Can't wait to see how your tree elevator turns out.
