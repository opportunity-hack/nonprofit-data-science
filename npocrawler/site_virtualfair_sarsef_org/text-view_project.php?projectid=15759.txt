For my project, I wanted to design a prototype that would help structurally support coral reefs. However, because I do not have access to a coral reef to test out, I chose to use materials instead. I wanted to do this project because conservation is important to me, and coral reefs are important ecosystems. I found out that PVC piping attached to the joints using PVC glue was the best solution.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Great project  Katie.  Used to live in Fla.  Protecting the coral reef is a big concern there.  UR research on structural support is really helpful.  Grampy
