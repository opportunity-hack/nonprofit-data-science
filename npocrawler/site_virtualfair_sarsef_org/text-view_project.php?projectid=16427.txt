While researching on what to add to my compost, I learned that grass clippings, coffee grounds, and egg shells all have high quality of nitrogen, phosphorus, and Ph. Then, I learned that most fruit and vegetables also, have high quality of nitrogen, phosphorus, and Ph. Later, I learned that the best compost bin in a circular one because it’s easier to mix and you are supposed to mix and feed the compost 2 times a day.

 I also learned about the different types of composts, I learned that you can compost many different ways such as ant and worm composting and the very common kind, mold composting. Mold composting is when you just add a lot of things together and mold slowly starts to grow and eat up the fruit and vegetables. Very slowly after compost starts to form. The difference between ant and worm compost is ant compost takes a lot longer than worm compost.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
