"I am interested in this problem because I am currently taking my classes remotely. I  find that online schooling is harder for me because I learn better in person. Also, I  believe that we students are not learning as much as we should be learning. I can also  say that many of my classmates and friends are struggling to understand these new  subjects that are being taught through remote teaching. I taught a subject  in-person and online to a group of people and then test them both in-person and online. I wanted to see if their test scores were better on the in-person test than the online test. My results showed that 50% of the students did not do better on one than the other, that 40% of the students did better remotely,  and that 10% of the students did better in-person.
