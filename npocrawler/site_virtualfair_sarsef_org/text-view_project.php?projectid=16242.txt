Good research to make the proper solution of salt/water to make seawater.Your graphs were clear and easy to understand.
I have never seen this done before, and I think this was a really cool experiment. I also really like the graphs and charts you used!
Great colorful, easy to read graphs
I like how you consulted a local expert to determine plant to grow, cups and potting soil to use. Always good to use local expertise
