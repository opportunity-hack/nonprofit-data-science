My Experiment was to find out whether the speed of wind
can be measured using an Anemometer made with
Legos.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Fascinating how you can measure something invisible. I didn't know what an anemometer was before this! Awesome work.
I can tell you learned a lot from this project.  Very well done!
