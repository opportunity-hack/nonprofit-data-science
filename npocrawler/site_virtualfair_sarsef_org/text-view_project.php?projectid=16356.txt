Building a Solar-Powered Birdbath

In the desert, rising temperatures are projected to substantially impact the health of small songbirds, with dehydration and hyperthermia becoming more common and more fatal. This project explored the use of a solar-powered Archimedes screw as a sustainable way to lift water to a birdbath basin. The screw dumped water into the basin at a steady rate, and the water level in the basin remained constant. However, no birds were observed in the basin as the motor noise scared them away from the basin. Steps were taken to fix this, but they proved inefficient.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Great idea to refill a birdbath using solar power! I love it! Great job! - Judge Tom
Amazing engineering and thoughts! The birds are going to be so grateful for your problem solving efforts.
