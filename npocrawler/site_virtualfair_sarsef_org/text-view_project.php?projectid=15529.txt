A human has their own perfect computer inside them: their brain, which is divided into two hemispheres. The left brain usually associated with logical tasks, like mathematics, while the right brain is usually associated with more creative tasks, like reading. While most people specialize in one of these two tasks, does doing this impact the other? This project aims to find the correlation between math academic achievement and reading academic achievement. ?

This project was conducted using the following methods: First, to get the information needed, a Microsoft Form was made. Second, to make sure the form was readily accessible, it was posted on every grade level in Microsoft Teams. Finally, the information obtained was compiled and plotted into graphs. Correlation was then found.?

The results of the experiment showed a weak positive correlation between Mathematics achievement and Reading proficiency in Harvest Preparatory Academy. This correlation was most prominent with High School, where most students had over a 75% in both subjects. This was closely followed by Middle School, which had a significantly weaker correlation. Finally, Elementary School had almost all students placed above an 85% in both subjects, with no correlation?

In conclusion, Mathematics achievement and Reading proficiency were shown to have a weak correlation with one another in Harvest Preparatory Academy. ?
This project has been cleared by SRC.
