HS-CM012
The Effect of Chemical Composition on the Effectiveness of Antacids
Chemical and Material Science

Maja Palmer, Maile Rand
Grade:
HS

Teacher:
Michael Frank, PhD

It is about how the effect of different antacids changes based on their chemical makeup, like sodium bicarbonate or aluminum hydroxide. 
We chose this project because we wondered if since different elements and compounds bond differently, if that would affect the way that antacids work and how good they are at neutralizing stomach acid. 
Our result was that aluminum hydroxide and calcium carbonate were the most effective antacids. 
It is important because it can be used to produce more effective antacids so that they are able to better neutralize stomach acid and decrease the amount of discomfort. It is also important because it can help when figuring what kind of antacids to produce more of, and advertise, based on what is the most effective neutralizer.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
