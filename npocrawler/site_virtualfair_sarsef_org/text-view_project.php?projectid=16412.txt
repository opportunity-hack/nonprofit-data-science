Hello, I am 14 years old and I currently live in Tucson, Az. The school that I go to is Borman K 8 and I am an 8th grader. I am also a military child.

I have always been a curious child and wondered life tiny mysteries. When I
started to learn about science from school and started talking about the smallest
things in life I always wondered how they actually work. So this experiment is
very special because even though I don’t like slime but I like the texture and how
it will react with what types of trash it gathers most and see if the putty toy is the
much better type of this kind of toy for which many people love.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
