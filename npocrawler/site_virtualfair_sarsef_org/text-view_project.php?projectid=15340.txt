4th grade project started with dialoging in a class meeting about things students wonder about. Brainstorming in this era of school mitigations due to the covid 19 pandemic led to unique difficulties in a hybrid and remote learning setting. With water fountains inaccessible, we found we were experiencing new challenges. It was time to start solving problems, we were encountering. The 4th graders wanted to decrease noise level, distraction, and spillage. We needed to engineer water bottle holder system. We created water bottle holders to decrease disruptions.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
