This project considered density, gravity, and buoyancy to find out how sharks stay under water. I thought that a liver filled with oil would be more buoyant than a liver filled with air and blood (water).

Some results were unmeasurable because our measuring cup did not have exact measurements. I measured to the closest 25mL. I found that shark oil had the greatest density. This allows to be more buoyant than humans or fish. I also discovered that fish have little density and buoyancy. I was surprised that water was not much different than the oil.

Based off my results, my hypothesis that a liver with oil would be more buoyant than a liver filled with blood (water) or a swim bladder with oxygen was correct.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Good, colorful graphs. The graphs gave a good visual representation of your data. Good photos, they give a good visual about how you set things up.
