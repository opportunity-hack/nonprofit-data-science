The "Are We There Yet?"

Have your kids ever been on a road trip and asked the question, Are We There Yet? If so my project is something you will want to have in your car. When my family is on a road trip my mom holds her finger up on the car mirror and shows me how close we are to our destination. This gave me the idea to create a meter to show kids how much time they have left in the car. I made a device using a zipper that hangs from the mirror. As you drive on your trip your parents zip the zipper. When the zipper is all the way closed you are there. This is important so your parents are not distracted while they are driving when their kids constantly ask, Are we there yet?

I think this is very creative! I hope you get to travel again soon!
I like that you took an everyday problem and found a way to make it easier for your parents and yourself to know how much further to go. Using a zipper was a great idea!
Cool idea! We think it's definitely worthy of a prize!
