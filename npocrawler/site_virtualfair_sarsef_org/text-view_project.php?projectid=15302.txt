Ethical Impacts: The Lack of Bioethics in Science and How It Affects Higher Education
Behavioral and Social Science

Chloe Atkins, Liam Superville
Grade:
HS

Teacher:
Jeremy Jonas

Key Words: Bioethics, Biosciences, Education, Ethical, Survey, Animal Testing, Ethical Alternatives

Our project is about the impact of the lack of bioethics in science education on different demographics in the community. Our project is important to us and to the community overall because a more ethical, inclusive community means more ethical and diverse study and progression forward.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Interesting idea. I would love to see the results of the other questions as well. Good job including profs. that have dissection as part of their class. More credibility there. Thanks- well done.
