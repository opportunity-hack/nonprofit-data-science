Is it possible to charge a phone or a mobile gaming device using only bananas?  Certain fruits (like bananas) have enough acidity in them to conduct electricity, and, with the right materials, it is possible to harness some of this electricity.  Perhaps even waste fruit could serve as a source of electricity.  In this study, one hundred half bananas were wired together and zinc nails were inserted into the bananas.  The first trial of a single banana resulted in a reading of 0.8 volts. The sixth and final trial of the one hundred halves after two days of ripening resulted in a reading of 25.7 volts.  While not enough to power a device, it does demonstrate the power of ripened fruit.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

I like how you changed the size and number of fruit to see the impacts. Interesting to see the change after aging the fruit as well. Keep sciencing!
