Our prototype will help clean up waste. We chose this project because the entire class sees poop and trash when they go on walks or to the park. We think it is important to keep our planet clean.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Way to go 4th graders! This was awesome!
I Like the concept! You used a issue that no could do, yet you did it in a creative and fashionable way! Good Job!
