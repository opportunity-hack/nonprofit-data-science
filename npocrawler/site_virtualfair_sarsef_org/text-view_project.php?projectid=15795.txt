Baseball in one of the most popular sports in the USA! Players get paid millions of
dollars to hit the ball as far as they can. I currently play club baseball and I was
curious if the type/brand of baseball bat affects the distance the ball travels when
hit? In this experiment, I will test five different kinds/brands of baseball bats to see
which one hits the ball the farthest. Does the more expensive bat deliver better
results at the plate? I got my inspiration from two of my uncles in the MLB. Also, I
want to see if my club team can save a little money on bats and get similar or
better results when hitting.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
