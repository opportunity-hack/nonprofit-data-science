Jarvis: The Safer AI
Engineering, Robotics, and Computer Science

My project goal was to create a safer AI that does not collect and use any unnecessary information from its users. I chose this project because I wanted to create a safer way to ask questions and receive answers and to generate more fun and personalized answers for more queries. In the end, Jarvis was operational and able to respond quickly and accurately to all queries and prompts. My project is important because internet privacy is both vital and decreasing, and that needs to be changed.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
