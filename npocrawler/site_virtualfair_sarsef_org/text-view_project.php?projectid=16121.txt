The project compares results when adults and children use fitness trackers to monitor heart rate during exercise. The student chose the project because he wanted to borrow his mom's Garmin watch.  The results showed that in comparison to a chest strap, wrist monitors have a larger variation that chest strap monitors.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
