My project compared different types of soil to observe the amount of erosion in each type of soil. I chose this project because I saw a lot of news on the tv about major landslides triggered by heavy rain, and I wanted to see which type of soil is safe from erosion. My results were that the potting soil had the least amount of erosion, and also the biggest plant growth. This project is important because in the real world, events such as erosion and landslides happen, and they cause problems for people and ecosystems.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
