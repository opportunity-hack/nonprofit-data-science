The project's purpose is to find out if music will help plants grow faster. I choose this project to test if music will help plants grow faster so people can gather medicine and food faster. The conclusion was depending on the type of music, classical music grew faster than rock music but the integrity of the rock music listening plant was poor. The no music plant grew the fastest and the most sprouts, making my hypothesis incorrect. My project was important to help speed up the plant growing process in hopes of getting food and medicine faster.
This project has been cleared by SRC.


Comments

Marigolds a good choice to use for the plant - grows fast and upright so easy to measure
Good that you saw the need for consistent sun pattern for the plants. Light needs to be the same for all the plants
Your graphics are very helpful. Thank you!
