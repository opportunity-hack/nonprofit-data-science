The Dryer Ball Showdown
Energy and Environmental Engineering

The purpose of my science fair project is to determine which (if any) dryer ball is the most effective at drying in the hopes of saving energy one laundry load at a time. While I thought the plastic dryer balls would be the most effective, my results indicate that the laundry dries faster with no dryer balls.  This information is important for people who are energy conscious and want to eliminate unnecessary dryer usage or for those who want to dry their clothes as fast as possible.

This project has been cleared by SRC.


Comments

Good to know, I use dryer balls thinking I'm doing something good for the planet.  Maybe using less energy to dry, and no dryer balls or anything else is ever better.  Thanks, well done project!
