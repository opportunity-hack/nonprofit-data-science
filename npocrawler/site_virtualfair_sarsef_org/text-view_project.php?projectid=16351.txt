Changes in Bile Acid During Obesity and Prebiotic Treatment

My project is about the effects of obesity and prebiotic supplementation on bile acid signalling. I chose this project because I have always had an interest in understanding how such small changes within the body and microorganisms could lead to major external effects (such as obesity and metabolic disorders). Obesity is also very prevalent in the nation, affecting nearly 40% of people, so I was interested in learning more about it. Overall, the research found that high fat feeding altered the abundance of several bile acids, and this effect was reversed with oligofructose supplementation. It is important to understand the role of bile acids towards obesity development because it could lead to future hypotheses that search for potential novel therapies for the treatment of obesity.

Keywords: obesity, bile acids, gut microbiome, metabolism
