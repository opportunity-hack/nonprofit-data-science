This project is about how if screen time could affect your sleep. We chose this project because during the pandemic we have been on our screens a lot, so we were wondering if we spent the recommended amount from the pediatrics then would that improve our sleep. Our overall results/conclusions was that using recommended amount of screen time has a tiny improvement on your sleep. This project is important because sleep is very important. Sleep helps recharge your body, restart your metabolism, help kids grow, and keep you energized, so we were wondering if we could improve our sleep through using less screens.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
