Hi! I am in 6th grade, I'm 11 years old, and I am a student at Borman K 8 School in Tucson AZ. I have always loved looking at the weather outside, and I love predicting the weather!! I love predicting the weather with my dad because he is a Meteorologist in the United States Air Force! Predicting the Weather is so much fun!

I am doing this for my science experiment because ever since I was a little girl, I have always been looking at the weather, and have always been curious about predicting it! My goal while doing this is to see if I can predict the weather for the week, and to see if I will be correct without looking at the internet to see what the weather will be like!
This project has been cleared by SRC.


Comments

This sounds like a fun project. I wonder what you could do to increase the accuracy of your predictions. Could you look for any patterns? Or maybe see how changes in air pressure predicts weather?
Keep trying. Even meteorologists get it wrong a good percentage of the time.
Congratulations 'Aspiring Meteorologist', from a son of an US Army Meteorologist.
