8-HW005
The Dilemma of Mask
Health and Wellness

Roberto Alday
Grade:
8

Teacher:
Kim Bennett

My project is about which mask helps protect against COVID-19 and other viruses better.
I chose this project because my brother works at TMC with COVID patients daily, and I have seen the different masks he has to wear.
My overall conclusion was that the best mask, especially, for our health care heroes is the N95.They are the best to protect against all these viruses.
My project is important because we are living in a global pandemic, and right now we need to take all the precautions to help save all the lives possible.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
