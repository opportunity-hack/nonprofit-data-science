The Burrito Diaper

Have you ever been so excited to take a huge bite out of a stuffed burrito, just to have all it's delicious contents spill out? Well, my brother and I have this problem all the time. All of the stuff comes out of the “butt” of the burrito. I’ve invented something that solves this annoying problem. Purchasing the silicone was easy. In the end, I had a hard time thinking of improvements. Cutting was really hard. How to fold it the right way was difficult too. The velcro failed and wouldn’t stick. I plan to continue to improve the design by engineering better latch.

This is such a creative engineering idea! I know I could definitely use the Burrito Diaper.
You figured out a solution to a problem many people experience when eating a burrito. You faced the challenge and came up with a solution. Good job! Making it edible would be icing on the cake!
Very creative. You are a great problem solver! Way to go.
