The purpose of this project was to find the optimal fabric for mask making. This project was chosen because of the pandemic that has spread all around the world. Understandably, people are confused about the effectiveness of masks. The result of this experiment was that masks do in fact work, and that flannel fabric, polyester fabric, and plush fabric were the most efficient towards keeping people safe. This project was especially important to know if those who want to make homemade masks which fabric to buy that is the most effective.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
