Although the world uses technology we still consume a lot of paper. Using paper contributes to deforestation which is making climate change worse. I wanted to see if I could reuse waste to create paper. Unfortunately, none of my protoypes worked. This is important because we need to find creative ways to conserve and reuse materials and watse where we can, so we can eliminate trash that goes to the landfill.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

What a great idea! If only there was a better way to make paper! Great job doing multiple tests! I encourage you to keep going! Are there other materials that you can try that might be more fibrous?
Good concept. Keep thinking, keep researching, keep testing.
