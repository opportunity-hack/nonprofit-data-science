What Metal Magnetizes the Fastest?
Chemical Sciences

Grade:
5

Teacher:
Lindsay Wong

This project experiments to determine which type of metal can be magnetized the fastest.  It is important to know what metal magnetizes 
(called ferromagnetism) the fastest, because this will allow you to easily create magnets for use. I magnetized 3 different metals to see which one magnetized the fastest. Iron magnetized the fastest, nickel the slowest, and cobalt was in between.

magnetism, metal science, ferromagnetism
This project has been cleared by SRC.
