In this experiment we will find out if the size of the balloon affects how long it can fly.
I wanted to find out if the balloon is bigger will it last longer in the air.
I found that the bigger the balloon the longer it will fly.
Hot air balloons are an alternative way to travel and they don't pollute.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Great work!  You learned to test your thinking with measurements!
What a great idea! I love all the pretty rainbow colors. I was a little worried when I saw "toaster" on your supplies list, but you cleaned out crumbs to make sure it wouldn't burn. Smart!
