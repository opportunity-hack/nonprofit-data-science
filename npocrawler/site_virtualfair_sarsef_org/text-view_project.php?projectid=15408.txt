HS-BE009

My project is about the potential correlation between daily screen time and the overall mental health of teenagers. I chose this project because I was curious as to how spending time on cellphones could impact the mental health of the teenage population. I found that there was a positive correlation between stress level and daily screen time, meaning that those with higher amounts of screen time were more likely to experience higher levels of stress. This is important because it can help society understand the experiences that teenagers go through during their transition to adulthood.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
