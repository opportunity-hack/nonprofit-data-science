Sacred vs. Security: Investigating the Effects of US Border Wall Construction on Quitobaquito Springs

Our project is about how the border wall affected the Quitobaquito water level and if the wall is still affecting the water level to this day. The Quitobaquito springs and lake are located near the border, so the spring is on the Southwestern side of Arizona. We chose this project because we already had a mentor from the USGS to help us understand how Quitobaquito is just an example of the overall problem of Arizona's water. From what we saw from our results, the water level was decreasing slowly since June of 2020. But once the wall was completed, the water level has been slowly increasing. Our project is important because we show a part of the overall picture, which is the problems of the conservation of Arizona's water. Especially since the situation at Quitobaquito is the most evident display of human impact on water supplies.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
