Animal and Plant Sciences

Grade:

Teacher:
Shannon Jeffrey

Why I did what type of soils do plants grow best in is because me and my family do a lot of gardening and are garden all ways turns out that nothings growing. When I was doing this experiment  I found out that you should stay with potting soil. My project was important because gardeners can see what type of soils they should plant their plants in.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Good job.  Would have liked to hear more about how project was done and watering, checking, etc.
This is a very interesting project.  My family are gardeners and we’re always interested in gardening science.  Keep up the great work!
This was a very good topic! I really appreciated the thoughtfulness behind your hypothesis and the details you provided. Great job on this project! I hope your garden grows strong now.
