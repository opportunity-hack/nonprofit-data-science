I am a 11 year old sixth grader at Borman Elementary in Tucson, AZ. I started to like engineering when I went to see the planes my dad worked on. I thought it was cool, how they put things together and fixed things. I started liking this when I was like 8 or 9. I liked to look inside of the planes to see its parts. On the right is a picture of me in a plane. I also like to watch YouTube videos of people putting things together like Legos, or just building things.

I am doing this experiment because I've always wanted to build something like a bridge and now I have the opportunity to do that. Also, I wanted to see which popsicle bridge could hold the most weight. I a m using different glues to see which one can stick better to wood and hold the longest.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
