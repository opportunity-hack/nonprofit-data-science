We wanted to find out if 20 seconds was the right time for handwashing or is a shorter time or a longer time more effective?
This project has been cleared by SRC.


Comments

Your study helped me know the right hand washing time!
Sometimes even I think 15 seconds is enough. No more shortcuts for me! Awesome and informative!
This is a very important question to ask to prevent people from spreading germs. Thanks for confirming that 10 seconds is not long enough!
Good Project on finding the length of items! I enjoyed reading and looking at the measurements you presented!
