The EPA estimates that as much as 50% of the water we use outdoors is wasted due to inefficient watering methods. The Auto Soil Testing and Hydration System conserves water by watering only when the plant needs it. It turns on when the soil is dry and turns off when it is hydrated. The system is affordable, effective, and environmentally friendly.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Wow! You really worked hard to develop the prototypes. This is a great idea to solve a real-world problem.
