Behavioral and Social Sciences

Grade:

Teacher:
Mrs. Oslund

This project attempts to determine if birth order (oldest child, middle child, youngest child or only child) impacts the different components of a person's personality type. Myers-Briggs is a well-established personality typing system. It consists of 4 components (Introvert/Extrovert, Sensing/Intuitive, Thinking/Feeling, and Judging/Perceiving.) A person's personality type is determined by having them answer a series of questions. For the purpose of this project, the Keirsey Temperament Sorter was used to determine the Myers-Briggs personality type for over 150 people, utilizing a digital form presented over social media.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
