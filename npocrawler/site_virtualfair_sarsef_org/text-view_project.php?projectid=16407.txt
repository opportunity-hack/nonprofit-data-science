The Power of Drops - How the Proportionality of Small to Large Raindrops Affects Erosion

My project is about calculating the proportionality of small to large raindrops and then testing it out on erosion to find whether the raindrops' proportionality stays the same when applied to erosion, and how it affects the erosion.

I chose this project because erosion is a large problem in today's world, and has devastating consequences for some geological features. Maybe with this, we can start heading towards how to predict erosion based on the geographical area, as each place on Earth has an average amount of annual rain percentage and type of rain.

My result/overall conclusion was that drops do stay proportional, but they do affect erosion differently. Larger drops tended to bring out larger pieces of dirt which caused more erosion at first, but small drops also tend to bring out more erosion sometimes because they erode finer amounts of sediment. Overall, it depends on the situation, but the proportionality does stay.

This experiment is important because this is a step in the right direction to predicting erosion that has such a devastating effect on many geological/geographical landforms and formations. This is also good knowledge for future rainfall simulators.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
