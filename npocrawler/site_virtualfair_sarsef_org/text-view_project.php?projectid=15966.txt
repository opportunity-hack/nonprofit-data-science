Lemon Seeds
Animal and Plant Science

Grade:
7

Teacher:
Adelle McNiece

The purpose of this experiment is to know if the size of a lemon affects the number of seeds it has. I became interested in this experiment when I saw it in the 200 science fair projects list and it seemed interesting so I decided to try it.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
