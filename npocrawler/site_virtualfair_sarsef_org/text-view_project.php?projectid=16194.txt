Good job, nice sample, pics and graphs!
Great thought in trying many different types of solution for rose growing. There are many who will be interested in your results.
What a clever project! I never would have thought apple cider vinegar would keep a rose alive longer than flower food. Great job!
What a surprising result! Great job at conducting a detailed analysis and observation.
You had incredible details and procedures for this project! The photos were an excellent addition - great job. I am glad to know how to keep roses alive the longest now - I learned a lot.
The details of the project are good! The concept is good! This project is very good visually as well! Average Project, with good qualities!
I thought your project was really interesting
