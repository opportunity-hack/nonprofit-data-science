Music? What Will We Do Without It?
Behavioral and Social Sciences

Mathew Moukabary
Grade:
5

Teacher:
Alicia Barrios

It has been shown that music can really affects a person’s concentration ability. Studies have shown that “music activates both the left and right brain at the same time, and the activation of both hemispheres can maximize learning and improve memory.” Music can also help people relieve stress or help students reduce test anxiety. It has been shown that music can also help people perform better in high pressure situations. Since music has been shown to be a beneficial tool, why not use music to improve a person’s performance. If students are assigned a task and they are allowed to listen to music while working, will they perform better than if they do not have music while working? Because music relieves stress and reduces distractions, students should perform better on their task while listening to music than if they do not.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
