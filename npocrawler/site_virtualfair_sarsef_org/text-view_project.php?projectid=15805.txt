Eliminating charcoal from a terrarium to see the effects on the mini biosphere.
This project has been cleared by SRC.


Comments

Good project. Easy to see the difference between the control (with charcoal) and the experiment (no charcoal). I never realized how important the charcoal is to have a successful terrarium.
The pictures are very helpful!
This is a very creative experiment! Good job! In a real biosphere, this is bound to happen!
