The Toilet Paper Challenge
Earth and Environmental Sciences

Mrs. Middendorf

My project was about which toilet paper would dissolve the fastest and be best for the environment. I chose this project because I was curious what was the difference between all of the different brands of toilet paper.  The results of my project were that Angel Soft toilet paper dissolved the fastest, Kirkland brand was next and finally, Charmin Ultra Strong came in last. My project is important because it demonstrates how quickly toilet paper breaks down wish is helpful to plumbing and septic systems.
This project has been cleared by SRC.


Comments

looks like I may be switching to angle soft.  Seem it may be better on the toilet, and the environment if it dissolves fastest.
Thank you so much for participating in this year's science fair.  I hope you join us at next year's SARSEF.
