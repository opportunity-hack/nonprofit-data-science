Which Dance Move Best Affects Your Heart Rate?
Health and Wellness

Julissa Piedrahita
Grade:
7

Teacher:
MariAnn Slater

What is your project about?
I am doing this experiment for my fellow dancers that could use more information about what they do in their everyday lives.

Why did you choose this project?
I chose this project because I’ve always wanted to get more in depth with my experience with dance. I believe that incorporating dance with academic projects allows me to better enjoy and understand what it is that I am working on.

What was your result/overall conclusion? 
My results showed that the “pop-russian” dance move affects my heart rate the most.

Why is your project important?
My project is important for those that are more cautious about their health when it comes to physical activity.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
