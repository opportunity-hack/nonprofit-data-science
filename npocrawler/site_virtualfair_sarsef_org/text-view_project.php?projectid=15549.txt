How Permanent Are These Permanent Markers?
Chemical Science

Our Project is about how to remove one of the most popular permanent markers, the Sharpie, and to see which one of our selected solvents will remove the marker stains from our materials. We chose this project because we thought that this subject was very interesting and we really wanted to dive into the world of science! Our result was that the solvent Vinegar removed the marker stains best out of our materials! Our project is important because with these experiments, we are able to dig deep into the science and actually see how these marker are pemanent and what chemicals they contain, and we are able to solve the problem of how to remove their stains that just won't come off!
This project has been cleared by SRC.
