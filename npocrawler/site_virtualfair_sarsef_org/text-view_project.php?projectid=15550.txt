HS-BE015
The Impact of Video Games on Daily and Social Life
Behavioral and Social Science

Grade:
HS

Teacher:
Tara Archuleta

My project is about the impact of video games on daily life. I chose this project because I love video games so I thought I should do a project on something I enjoy. My results were that video games had a moderate impact on the lives of people who played them. My project is important because video games have grown increasingly present in everyone's lives and it's important to know just much they affect life
This project has been cleared by SRC.
