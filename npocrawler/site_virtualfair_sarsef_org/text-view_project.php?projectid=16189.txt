HS-EA030
Carbon Dioxide's Effect on the pH of Seawater
Earth and Environmental Science

Adalyn Thompson
Grade:
HS

Teacher:
Michael Frank, PhD

My project is on how the pH of seawater (8.1) is affected by the absorption of carbon dioxide. I chose this project because of the environmental dangers of ocean acidification. My conclusion was that the more carbon dioxide I added, the more acidic the water became. My project is important because everyone needs to be informed about the dangers of ocean acidification.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
