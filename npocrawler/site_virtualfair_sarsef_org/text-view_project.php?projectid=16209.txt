The Effect of Different Cooking Methods on Vitamin C in Capsicum annuum
Chemical and Material Science

Michael Frank, PhD

My project is about how different cooking methods will affect the amount of vitamin C in yellow bell peppers. I chose this project as I thought it was interesting and it is something that affects us every day. My overall conclusion was that vitamin C is negatively affected by all of the cooking methods tested, more specifically that cooking the peppers in water was the most detrimental to the vitamin C content in the yellow bell peppers. My project is important as vitamin C is an essential nutrient that the human body needs in order to stay healthy and so it is vital that we know how cooking foods affects vitamin C so that we are able to get enough of it.
