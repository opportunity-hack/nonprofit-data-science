Physics, Astronomy, and Mathematics

Grade:
7

Teacher:
MariAnn Slater

1.The purpose of my project is to find out how different temperatures affect a battery's life.
2. I chose this project because I wanted to see if temperature had an effect on batteries.  
3. The result of my experiment is my data shows that battery’s in warmer environments last longer than batteries in cold environments
4. My project is important because it helps us know what temperatures to store our batteries to make them last the longest.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
