Can You Breathe?
Health and Wellness

Mrs. Belden Class
Grade:
3

Teacher:
Mrs. Belden

"1. Students will conduct and experiment to determine if sweating while wearing a face mask during play time or exercising affects breathing. Students will create a tool to measure the amount of carbon dioxide exhaled. They will gather and analyze their results. 2. The students create a list of experiments that are relevant to 3rd grade and voted for Can You Breathe. 3. Our hypothesis was correct, if a mask is moist from sweating during playtime or exercising then the amount of carbon dioxide exhaled will be less and breathing will be difficult. 4. The project was importnat as students learned that sweating while wearing a face mask affects our respiratory system, making it uncomfortable and difficult to breathe. We also noticed during our experiment that our heart rate and body temperature also intensified. These observations could have also affect the projects results.
After completing our experiment we would suggest shorter playtimes, cloth mask and frequent mask breaks in a safe area.
"
This project has been cleared by SRC.

This was a very interesting and timely topic! The take home experiment kits were really awesome. Great job on this project!
I admire the design of this project--how you tested your question, the data collected. Good work!
