Lint in Pockets

This project started with a simple observation and question: why is there lint in our pockets? Lint, in addition to being a curiosity and a slight annoyance, can also be a source of environmental pollution. We hypothesized that pocket lint was formed during daily activities by causing friction in the clothing fabric. We tested two active activities (running and biking) against a non-active activity (sitting), and found that active activities did produce more pocket lint, though the amounts were small overall. This research should help scientists in the future as they test fabrics and look to reduce lint pollution.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
