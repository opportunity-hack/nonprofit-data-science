Happy Avocados

Grade:

Teacher:
Mrs. Lang

I'm am going to take five avocados and put one in the fridge, one on the counter, one in a brown bag on the counter, one in a brown bag with a apple, and one in a brown bag with a banana. I will check on them every day for a week then leave them and rethink my hypothesis then check them on day 14. I want to see witch way will help them ripen fastest.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Super job! Now I know if I need to keep and avocado for a while I'll stick it in the fridge, and if I need it right away I'll bag it with an apple. :) Thanks for the helpful information.
