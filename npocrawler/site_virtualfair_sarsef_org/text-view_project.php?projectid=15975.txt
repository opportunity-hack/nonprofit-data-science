Niki Tilicki Class
Grade:

Teacher:
Niki Tilicki

In this pandemic, we have had a great deal of time at home to snack, but what are we drinking? We studied our favorite drinks from the taste, smell, and popularity  to their chemical content and acidity. We learned from doctors what nutrition is important and the dentist told us what it would do to our teeth. We then did different tests on our drinks, evaporating, heating, and freezing to see the contents separate and react.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
