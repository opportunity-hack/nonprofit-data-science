Do Video Games Affect Your Reaction Time?
Behavioral and Social Sciences

Grade:

I got the idea for this experiment because I play video games. Many people talk about how bad video games are so that gave me the idea to do this experiment. I wanted to do this project because everyone is saying that video games make you lazy and I wanted to know if that was true so I did this experiment. The experiment could influence people to play more or less video games based on whether the results show a positive or negative impact of video games on reaction time.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
