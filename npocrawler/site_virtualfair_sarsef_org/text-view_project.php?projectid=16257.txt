What Type of Milk Has the Most Foam?

Grade:

Teacher:
Alicia Barrios

Did you know that you can froth milk by simply comparing it
by putting it in a jar and then shaking? I found that when
air is mixed with the force of the milk frother it creates a
bubble formation reaction on top of the milk and a fluffy
texture. I also wanted to do this project because I love
going to Starbucks and buying a vanilla vaporizer. But once I
grab one the amount of foam was different, this causes me to
ask ... why? So I asked and the person who works here and she said that maybe it was because the type of milk was different.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

I love the way you decided on a project.
Great personal connection.
Very creative project - I love that you investigated a question from your own life
I love it that you had a real life question and that you found a way to make an experiment.  It seems like you learned a lot that you will use in your life.
