My project is about gaming and how it can improve some new skills along the way. I gathered 4 gamers and 4 non-gamers to complete a reaction time test. I am a gamer myself and was curious to see the side effects that gaming can bring. The results were not shocking but did side with the gamers overall. I believe my project is important because human brains all develop in different ways and gaming could be a factor in improving the brain's development.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
