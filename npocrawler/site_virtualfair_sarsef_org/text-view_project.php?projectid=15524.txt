Nice job, try centering your table information to make it easier to read
I’m surprised also by your results. Maybe the dishwasher should be “swabbed “ for bacteria.
What a great idea for a project! I really don't like washing dishes by hand, but you've shown that's a more effective way to clean dishes. Keep up the good work and help with the dishes at home!
