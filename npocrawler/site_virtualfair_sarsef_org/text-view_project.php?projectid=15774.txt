The goal of my project was to see which type of dark liquids stain teeth the darkest. The results from my project we that Soda seemed to stain teeth the darkest. Coffee was in 2nd place and black tea came in 3rd. This project is important because people spend a lot of money each year on teeth whitening and dental care.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Great job with this very practical research! You are right that it is important considering how much money people spend on whitening teeth!
