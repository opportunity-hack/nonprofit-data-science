What is your project about?
It's a bout a water sprinkler I made to help prevent fires from starting or becoming bigger.

Why did you choose this project?
Because last year in 2020 we had  tons of fires and anchors of land was destroyed and one of the fires was at Mount Lemmon and I used to go up there with my family and I would think it's so beautiful but since the fire started everything look so dark and it creates pollution for us. 

What was your result/overall conclusion?
  For my invention to help firefighters fires the start.


Why is your project important?
Because thousands of fires happen each year and because of those fires many lives are lost so I think with my invention it can help prevent those from happening and help the environment.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
