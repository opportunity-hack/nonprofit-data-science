Catapults are fun! Catapults are old machines used to throw items over castle walls. I chose this project because they seem interesting, and I hoped to learn how they work. I believed that by changing the tension and launch degree, the distance the projectile object travels would change. I believed that if I increased the launch degree, the projectile would travel farther.  


To test this hypothesis, I bought a catapult online, determined the desired launch angle, pull-back angle, type of ball, and number of rubber bands, then launched the ball. For the second trial, I adjusted the launch angle and pull-back angle and launched the ball again to note any differences in distance that the projectile traveled. A total of two trials were conducted.  My hypothesis was proven to be correct. In Trial One, the ping pong balls travelled a shorter distance, to include going backwards. In Trial Two, when the pull-back angle was increased, the ping pong balls travelled a greater distance.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
