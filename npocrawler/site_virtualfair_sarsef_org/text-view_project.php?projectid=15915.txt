I wanted to do something with solar power because its a cool subject and eventually it will be able to power all the home in the world. For this project, I asked the question, how can a solar panel power a house at night when the sun isn't shining. In my research I learned that providing on-demand electricity is a challenge for solar power. On-demand is electricity that turns on when you want it or need it.  Solar power cannot provide on-demand energy because it's not always sunny to power the solar panels. When the solar panels don’t have sun, they don’t make electricity and they cannot store any electricity to use later. 
The purpose of my project is build a system to store energy for solar panels, so they can save the electricity for later when the sun isn’t shining. Common batteries can store electricity, but are not good for the environment, so my system will not use common batteries.
My project can impact people with solar panels
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Very interesting idea!
Great project! I work at TEP and this is a problem that many colleagues are trying to solve. Many adults don't understand what you already do - that solar power doesn't work at night! Keep it up!
Great project and I appreciate you working on the biggest challenge with solar - storage! I wonder what other ideas you have to potentially solve this important issue?
