What Brand of Water Is the Best?
Earth and Environmental Science

Grade:

Teacher:

My project is about pH testing different water brands to see if they are healthy. I chose this project because it seemed interesting and I wanted to know what water is safe. My conclusion was the Life Water is the best on the pH scale. This is important because people should be drinking healthy water
This project has been cleared by SRC.
