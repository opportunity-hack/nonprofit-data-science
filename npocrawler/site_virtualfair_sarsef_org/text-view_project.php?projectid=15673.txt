I Can See Clearly Now

I wear glasses and they get dirty often. So I wanted to know what was the best way to clean them. Specifically I wondered, what liquid cleans glasses the best and fastest: Glasses cleaner, soapy water 
or distilled water? I chose this project because I have always wondered what works best for cleaning my lenses. I found the distilled water and soap works the best because it got the glasses the cleanest but not the fastest. The distilled water was pretty equal in amount of cleanness but took longer to get clean. This project is important because it is really hard to keep lenses clean and knowing what works best will help people who wear glasses like me, keep them clean.
