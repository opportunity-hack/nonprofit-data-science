HS-PS015
The Effect of Different Solutions on the Growth of Pisum sativum
Plant Science

Dahlia Schorr
Grade:
HS

Teacher:
Elyse Wexler

The growth and germination of pea plants being affected by the hydration of different solutions (water and an added compound). Gardens are a fascinating and relaxing hobby which has so much to discover, including what can lead to faster growth. The overall result was solutions above 3:32 Ratio(sugar to water) will halt growth of pisum sativum. Watching as invasive species take over an ecosystem, or having weeds invade a yard, are both common problems, by finding a solution which can halt growth without being overly harmful to the surrounding area would be beneficial to many people and ecosystems.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
