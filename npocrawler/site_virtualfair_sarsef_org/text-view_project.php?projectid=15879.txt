Solar Desalination Using an Evacuated Tube Solar Collector

In this project student will make fresh water from salt water by evaporating it using an evacuated tube solar collector. I chose this project because I wanted to find out what will be the effect of using different materials for the condenser on the production of freshwater?
I found out evacuated tube solar collectors can be used to make
freshwater from saltwater by evaporation. This is important because most of the planet is ocean and we could make fresh water using and evacuated tube solar collector.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
