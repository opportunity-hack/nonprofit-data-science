The Super Puzzle Effect
Behavioral and Social Sciences

Lori Larussa Class
Grade:
2

Teacher:
Lori Larussa

Do grades effect success? We wanted to see if people were more likely to solve a task if it was a game or if they were being graded.  The "Super Mario Effect"  states that when students are more focused on the end product rather than the trials and failures they are more successful.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
