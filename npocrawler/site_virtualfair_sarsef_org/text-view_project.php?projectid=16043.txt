My project was about finding out where the energy from a bouncing basketball goes when dribbling it. I chose this project because I like basketball and I was curious where the energy goes after dribbling. The outcome of my project was the ball gave off less thermal energy than expected. My project is important because many people like basketball and they might want to know where the energy from a dribbling ball goes.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
