What Is Bernoulli’s Principle?   The Relation Between Speed and Pressure on a Fluid
Physics, Astronomy, and Mathematics

ome research, i learned that bernoulli’s principle made a important part of the process in which planes fly. It states that as the velocity of a fluid increases, the pressure exerted by that fluid decreases. Bernoulli’s principle is present not only in aerodynamics, but in Hydrodynamics too.

To perform the experiment, something able to exert a fluid at fast velocities was needed, a hair dryer proved sufficient enough. Now two soda cans were hanged with a string 12 cm apart from each other, next the hair dryer was placed in between the two cans and a stream of air was shot between the two soda cans, a second later the cans collided and the timer was stopped, this process was repeated ten more times with a change in the velocity of the air stream after the first five, then the distance between the cans would be increased by 1 cm. This process was repeated five more times

The results showed a strong correlation between the speed of the fluid and the time needed for the cans to come together.  

The conclusion made is that the hypothesis stating that the faster the speed of the air, the faster they will come together was correct according to the results gotten from the experiment
This project has been cleared by SRC.
