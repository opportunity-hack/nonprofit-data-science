What Materials Biodegrade the Best?

My project is what materials biodegrade the best. I wanted to do this project to show how important it is to be aware of the materials you use as well as show what you are doing to the environment. For my materials I used common objects such as 1 apple, 1 chile pepper, 1 piece of paper, 1 piece of plastic, 1 piece of foil, 1 piece of cardboard, 1 biodegradable straw, and 1 biodegradable spoon. I dug a hole that was 12 inches deep and 9 inches wide and placed all of my materials inside. I let all of my materials sit in the hole for 1 week. Once one week passed I took everything out. In the end the apple and the chile pepper rotted more and biodegraded the best. My hypothesis was correct, I said the apple or the pepper would biodegrade the best because they are fruits and animals could eat away the fruits. The rest of my materials that I took out of the hole looked brand new, this goes to show how long it takes for things to biodegrade. If you begin using biodegradable materials they will biodegrade into non toxic elements that will not harm the environment.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
