Telescopes cost a lot, ranging from $300 for a basic one to over $1000 for larger apertures. This sparked an idea to make a working, inexpensive telescope from materials around the house. The results were promising, though the 4th prototype was only capable of seeing small things in the neighborhood, there continue to be steps to improve the design to eventually see the stars. This homemade telescope can inspire people to want to learn more about astronomy, especially little kids who can build it and want to know more about astronomy.
This project has been cleared by SRC.


Comments

Well done!
Well done! Please continue with your work. You're on a good path towards having a working telescope. You learned the importance of focal length and the need to properly focus the image. Good job!
