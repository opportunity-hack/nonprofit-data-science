HS-MI004
The Volume of Microorganisms on Frequently Touched Surfaces in Public Places Before and After Foregoing Regular Cleaning
Microbiology

How effective is the regular cleaning of the frequently touched surfaces, in public on the growth of microorganisms? With the spread of COVID-19, it is essential to know the risks of going to the store and how well the sanitization is working. A coliform test was used to test the volume of microorganisms on the surfaces at the chosen stores, one with little to no cleaning and the other with extensive cleaning procedures. Both of the stores came back as having large amounts of growth of the microorganisms but the store with more cleaning had less growth of the organisms. I found that this topic was very interesting and I personally was intrigued to find out how well the cleaning works.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
