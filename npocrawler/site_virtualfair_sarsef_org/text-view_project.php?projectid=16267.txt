I came up with this idea when I was having dinner, I did this experiment because it looked like fun and I love to eat. I want to understand how serving sizes fill you up.
I researched about portion size and how it relates to serving size. When I read serving sizes I was curious how they started. IIn 1993, the FDA created the Nutrition Facts label, which are used to determine serving sizes, called Reference Amounts Usually Consumed (RACC).Serving sizes are the average amount people eat and not what you should eat. The serving size in the US is larger than other states serving size.
