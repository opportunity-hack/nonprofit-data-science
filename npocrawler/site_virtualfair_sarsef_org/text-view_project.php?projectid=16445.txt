Hamster Maze
Animal and Plant Sciences

Adalyn Lyders, Kenzee Lyders
Grade:
5

Teacher:
Mrs. Frankfort

My project is about trying to influence my hamster to go through a maze. I chose this project because I thought it would be interesting to see how smart hamsters are. By the end of each different maze, my hamster would have it memorized. It shows that hamsters could be trained to do important jobs.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Wow! what an interesting project. i really like what you chose. the resul
Fun project and great job!
Good data collection and graphs. They made it real easy to read and understand your results.
I like how at the end you wondered about things that might have influenced the results, like time of day or if Frost had memorized the course. Good thoughts to incorporate in the future.
