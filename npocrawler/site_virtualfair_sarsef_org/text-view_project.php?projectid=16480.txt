HS-HB029
The Bacteria Between Us: The Relationship Between Classrooms, Ventilation, and Airborne Bacteria
Health and Biomedical Science

Zoe Elizabeth Lynn, Angelina Jolie Stilwell
Grade:
HS

Teacher:

1. This project is about how BACTERIA travels through common VENTILATION and filtration systems in buildings in light of COVID.
2. This project was chosen to see how safe it would be to go back to in-class learning with minimal safety regulations.
3. The first uncommon bacteria count in a room with 6 output vents resulted in a number of 44 and the second only 10, and the first count in the second room with 2 output vents resulted in 19 and the second only 5. This led to conclude that the first room must leak into room two before being filtered out as well as proved that rooms with more output vents and higher air circulation rates clean out more bacteria. However, because Petri dishes cannot actually be placed in the ventilation unit there were no definitive results making this project overall inconclusive. 
4. This project is centered around finding the safest way to return to in class learning. It is a preliminary experiment leading up to the installment of the new GPS (Global Plasma Solutions) unit said to filter out the smaller COVID virus. (particle)
