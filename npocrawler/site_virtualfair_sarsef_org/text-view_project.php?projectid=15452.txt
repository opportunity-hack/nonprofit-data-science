Which Mask Is Better?
Behavioral and Social Sciences

Madhavi Rachakonda Class
Grade:
1

Teacher:
Madhavi Rachakonda

As COVID cases increase across the country, everyone is recommended to wear masks to slow the spread of this virus. During one of our class discussions, students wondered which mask works the best. Then, students wore their masks and shared their experiences of wearing masks.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

You made real world issues your problem! Way to go!
This project is very good! It educates others about which masks will keep you safe, and which ones won't.
This is a great project because it applies directly to the time we're currently living in. Thank you for contributing to research that'll help end this pandemic!
I really like this project!  It's so important to wear a mask that protects you and others and I'm encouraged to see you researched which mask is best!
