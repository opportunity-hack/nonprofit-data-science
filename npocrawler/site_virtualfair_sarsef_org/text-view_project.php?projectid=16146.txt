My project is about finding out if it is possible to have a habitable planet with two stars, like in Star Wars. I did this project because I want to know more about binary stars and black holes and I wanted to know if the twin stars in Tatooine in Star Wars are possible. I found out that you cannot have a habitable planet about two Sun binary stars because the planet escapes. You can place one small star around a big star, and a planet around the small star and the planet does not escape. It looks like Tatooine’s stars. But then that planet becomes too hot to live (172C). I think this project is important for us to understand which planets we can live on in space.

I hope your project was fun to do! It's interesting that a planet orbiting a pair of stars as in Star Wars would be hot. Wasn't Tatooine known as a hot planet? Maybe not as hot as you found, though.
Love this!
That was a very interesting project! Now I want to check out universe sandbox. Great job!
Interesting !
