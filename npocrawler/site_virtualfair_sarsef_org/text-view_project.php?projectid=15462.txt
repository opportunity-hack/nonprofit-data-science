My project studied the effects of Cinnamomum zeylanicum (cinnamon), Eucalyptus citriodora (eucalyptus), and Citrus aurantifolia (lime) essential oils on the shelf life of Italian bread products. I chose this project because essential oils have proven to possess antifungal abilities, and cinnamon, eucalyptus, and lime essential oils have not yet been tested at different concentrations against bread mold. Out of the three essential oils, cinnamon showed to be the most effective against bread mold, possibly because of its aromatic aldehyde structure. The establishment of an alternative for bread preservatives should give manufacturers a better understanding of their options to minimize potential health risks, as well as reduce global waste by keeping bread fresh for longer periods of time.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
