The Sedona Red Rock Experiment
Earth and Environmental Sciences

Grade:

Teacher:
Ellie Galligan

Since my many travels to Sedona I have often wondered how did the rocks get their beautiful red color? I thought I would recreate this process and take a normal sedimentary rock to turn it a red color. Maybe by adding hematite rock to water along with vinegar, lemon and salt, I can help the rock to erode to that authentic red color. It is known that when weather erosion occurs it can play an important role in the changes to our environment. This is an experiment to show just that!
This project has been cleared by SRC.

I like how your trip inspired your interest in geology. Keep looking at the world around you and asking questions!
You were right. Iron colors rocks shades of red, orange and brown. Can you think of any other elements/minerals that give color to rocks? For your next project, try other components and compare.
Thank you. Yes I would like to see how sparkles are in the rocks or mica is formed. -Cole Levy
Thank you for creating this experiment and the thought given to how the shades of rock are formed.  I hope you have the opportunity to expand your interest in geology!
