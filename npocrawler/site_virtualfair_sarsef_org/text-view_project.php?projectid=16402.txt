Teacher:
Ms. Alejandra Alvarez

Activated charcoal is mixed with water containing food coloring to clean the color out of the water. Charcoals' effect on different quantities of water with the ratios of food coloring to water kept proportional are compared. Project was chosen because participant's father works in water purification and it's interesting because water can be cleaned without a lot of expensive equipment. Charcoal settles at bottom and floats on top of liquid but water is clear. 
Key words: Activated Charcoal Water Purifying
This project has been cleared by SRC.
