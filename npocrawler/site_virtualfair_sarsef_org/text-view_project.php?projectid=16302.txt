Renovating a Mask
Health and Wellness

Grade:

Jennifer Mattes

I wanted to create a safer face mask because there are some masks that are not good to use and some that don’t protect you. This project is important to help people understand that you can not trust all masks and that is why my project is based on me renovating the normal mask to make it adjustable to your size and help protect you from COVID-19.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
