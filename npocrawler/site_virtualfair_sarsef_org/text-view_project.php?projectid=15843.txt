TRPM7 vs. Cancer
Health and Biomedical Science

My project is about the connection between TRPM7 levels and cancer prevalence. I chose this project because I am interested in human biology and genomes inside the body.  At the end of my data collection, I realized that there is a severe correlation between overexpression of TRPM7 in the human body and cancer being positively shown there. This project is important because if this research follows through millions and possibly billions of people could be saved from cancer.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
