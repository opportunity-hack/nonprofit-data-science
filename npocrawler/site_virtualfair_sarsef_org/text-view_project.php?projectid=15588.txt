HS-HB015
The Effects of a Sedentary Lifestyle on Frontotemporal Dementia Disease Severity: Lessons from a Drosophila melanogaster Model

Andrew Lettes, Ph. D.

1. My project is about how frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is affected by living a sedentary lifestyle. The experiment uses a genetically modified fruit fly to simulate how FTD would act in humans. In humans just like the flies, protein called TDP-43 grows outside of brain cells and inhibits brain function.

2. I chose this project because I’m interested in environmental factors and how they affect the individual. Because of the global pandemic I immediately thought of the sedentary lifestyle quarantine causes. I wanted to understand how a sedentary lifestyle affects FTD to be topical.

3. My results were contrary to the hypothesis that a sedentary lifestyle would lead to a more severe case of FTD. There was a variable that made this conclusion unstable, some of my sedentary flies would die. Since their cause of death was unknown it could’ve been from FTD or chronic stress, it is uncertain.

4. My project is important because it does research on FTD. FTD has no cure or treatment. It is important to identify the risk factors, like a sedentary lifestyle, so that doctors can inform those at risk to get a diagnosis.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
