Having a Blast With Bacteria

For our science fair experiment, we swabbed a communally used doorknob and cultured the bacteria in a homemade incubator of varying temperatures to test what conditions bacteria grows
best in. 

We chose our experiment because the covid-19 outbreak made us curious as to how the weather or time of year may affect the numbers of infected people due to a more suitable
environment for bacteria. 

Our results showed that the bacteria thrived the most in a temperature of 37 degrees Celsius.

 This experiment is important because it suggests that bacteria thrive the most in warm weather, which means that people may be more susceptible to infection during hot seasons, such as the summertime.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
