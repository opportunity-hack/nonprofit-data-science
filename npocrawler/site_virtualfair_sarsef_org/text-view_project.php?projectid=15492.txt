Pests and diseases account for billions of dollars of crop yield loss each year. Drought and rising temperatures leave millions of people hungry in developing countries each year. This study attempts to improve seed germination and drought tolerance in maize by pre-treating maize seeds with plant extract and acetic acid concentrations.  It was found that seeds treated with a plant extract/acetic acid solution germinated faster and were more drought tolerant than the control and standard growth techniques, thus providing a potential solution to increase drought tolerance and crop production in the world.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
