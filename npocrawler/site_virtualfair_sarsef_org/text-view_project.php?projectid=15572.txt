My project is about which water makes plants grow the fastest and healthiest. I chose this project because there might be better ways to grow plants. The result was that seltzer water makes plants grow the most efficiently.  My project is important so that one can have the best chance of growing healthy plants.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
