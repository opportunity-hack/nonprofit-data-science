The Resistance of Fruit
Energy and Environmental Engineering

Grade:
6

Teacher:
Kim Bennett

1. My project is about testing the resistance and conductivity of different types of fruit.
2. I wanted to first do a lemon battery, but it evolved into testing the resistance of different fruits that I found in the fridge. I wanted to see which one would make the best conductor of electricity for a battery.
3. All the fruits had roughly the same amount of resistance except one of the tomatoes.
4. It is important because it helped me identify other fruits that can conduct electricity and helped me to better understand how Ohms Law works and better understand how resistance works.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
