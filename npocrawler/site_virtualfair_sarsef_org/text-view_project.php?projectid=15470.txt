How Does Size Affect How Quickly Ice Melts?

I chose this project because I wanted to learn more about surface area and how it affects many things.  It will be valuable information for the future.  The results of this experiment was that the amount of surface area changed the melt time and left the test subject C standing.  This was valuable to me because it taught me things about surface area and how if affect a myriad of things.  Size and shape of surface area and exposure to atmosphere can change so many things.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Nice, very original!
How did you control for the volume to be the same in all three? If the volume is not the same, the differences could be attributed due to the volume differences.
Very nice pictures to complete your presentation!
