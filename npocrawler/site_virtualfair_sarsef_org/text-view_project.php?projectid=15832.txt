HS-BE025
Effects of Equine-Activities on Students' Grades and Academic Achievement
Behavioral and Social Science

Caitlin Reed
Grade:
HS

Teacher:
Elyse Wexler

My project explore the effect equine-related activities effects a students academic performance. I chose this project because I am fascinated with the influence external factors have on behavior, as well as the effect behavior has on academic performance. My overall conclusion was that though the correlation is minor, equine-related activities have a positive effect on a students academic achievement. My project is important because it provides a tool that can support students and allow them to be successful despite the obstacles they face.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
