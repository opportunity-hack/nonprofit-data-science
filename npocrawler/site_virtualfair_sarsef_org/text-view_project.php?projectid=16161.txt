How We Perceive Our Voices
Behavioral and Social Science

I'm experimenting with how we hear our own voices. What pitch we hear it in. Higher or Lower? I'll be experimenting with different people of different ages. I chose this project because it was an idea that popped into my head one day when I realized that my voice on video sounds so different from what I think my voice actually sounds like. My conclusion was that most people think that their voices have a lower pitch than the original pitch in recording.  Also, there is no definite pattern in age. This could help everyday people or even professionals see how we perceive our own voices-- how it reaches our eardrum in a different way. How it travels across the ear canal and cochlea. 
Keywords= Sound, Voices, Soundwaves, Perceiving
