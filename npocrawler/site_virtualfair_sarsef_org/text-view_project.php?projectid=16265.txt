Have you ever heard of “Devil’s Toothpaste” or “Elephant’s Toothpaste?” They are similar, but Devil’s Toothpaste is much more explosive & the recipe is unknown; my goal was to find the exact ingredients to make it.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Good work.  Keep looking for that special catalyst!
It was great speaking with you. I also agree that it was surprising the yeast was the most reactive. You took many steps to make sure this was done safely.
This looked like it was a fun experiment! I hope you had a fun job with this, and I liked how you said this is an experiment we can do at school that was safe.
