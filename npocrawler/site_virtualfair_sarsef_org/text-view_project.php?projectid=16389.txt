Elevation Competition
Animal and Plant Science

Our project was about seeds from three different elevations, and how they respond to the Sonoran Deserts winter environment. We chose this project because we thought that it would be important to research how plants from different elevations adapt to a different climate/environment. The Desert Colors seed mix from the lowest elevation ended growing the best overall, however the middle elevation plants grew well too. Our project is important because, due to climate change, natural habitats have been ruined so if we can figure out where plants can adapt to, then we will be more successful in growing different species of plants.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
