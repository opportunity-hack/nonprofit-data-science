HS-BE004
Relationship Between High School Grade Levels and Levels of Procrastination
Behavioral and Social Science

Riana Guinanao
Grade:
HS

Teacher:
Elyse Wexler

My project is about comparing levels of procrastination to different high school grades levels and seeing how much they vary as well as what are the main factors that impact these differences. I chose this project because, personally I’ve had a problem with procrastination while being in different grade levels and I wanted to see if there was some sort of pattern that I could detect.  The results of this project  showed that freshmen had the highest procrastination average out of any grade level while seniors had the lowest. I think that schools could be able to use this information to help their students
This project has been cleared by SRC.
