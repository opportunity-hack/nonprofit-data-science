My project is about helping kids at home who want to play softball but can't, so I created The Softball Robot.  I chose this robot because 1. I love softball, and 2. to help the kids who want to play softball.  My overall conclusion was using a cardboard robot for a model.  This project is important to me because I really care about people who want to follow their dream, but need help with it.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
