This project is about finding the yielding point of each species of wood. The designers talked about it and we only had a certain amount of time so we chose this project. The results were that some soft woods are stronger than hard woods. The project is important because if you wanted something that would be sturdy, you could decide between a hard wood and a soft wood.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
