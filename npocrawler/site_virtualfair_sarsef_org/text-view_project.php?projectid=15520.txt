I am going to be popping 15 bags of popcorn(5 brands with 3 bags each) trying to find the brand with the least amount of unpopped kernels on average. I will be counting the amount of unpopped kernels in each bag. I will take the average of unpopped kernels from each brand and then I will see which brand had the least amount of unpopped kernels on average. I chose this project because I hate it when there is kernels in my popcorn and I wanted to see which brand would give me the least kernels. In conclusion, I found that Pop-Secret Homestyle butter had the least kernels on average.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
