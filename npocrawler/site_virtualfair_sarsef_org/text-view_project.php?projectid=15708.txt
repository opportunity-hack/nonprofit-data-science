Adolescents vs. Peer Influence
Behavioral and Social Science

Gabriella Arroyo, Amanda Jean Miller
Grade:
HS

Teacher:
Elyse Wexler

Our project was aimed at researching the effects that adolescents have on each other, in a group environment, through peer influence. We found this topic extremely intriguing because of the effects that peer influence plays in our educational society. We found large results of peer influence among our participants and we hope that our results can help decrease these rates of peer pressure in the world, and bring awareness of these effects.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Wow Although it seems like this should be intuitive, I found it very eye opening. That is a very large rate of change. I wonder how brining this to the forefront of education would effect how we teach
Peer influence is such an important topic!  Thank you for doing this work.  Mrs. Wexler
Amazing slide deck presentation!
