My project is about the reaction of ice when met with different solids. I chose this project because I was looking for a way to help my mom clean out the ice build up in the freezer. I came to the conclusion that ice eventually melts, but you can speed up the process with aid of different solids. This would be important because it could help in other areas of the environment. 
Keywords:  Dissolve, Energy, Solids, Melting
This project has been cleared by SRC.
