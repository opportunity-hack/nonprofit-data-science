The purpose of this project is to improve the safety of kids in my neighborhood by using a ¨kids at play¨ sign to signal cars to slow down when they drive by. This is an improvement project based on results from my experiment last year of testing to see if cars would slow down when they see a ¨kids at play¨ sign on the road.  Results from last year showed that the ¨kids at play¨ signs didn't help cars slow down much.  A few changes were made to the sign so that it was standing higher on the sidewalk and was in a different position for cars to see better. The results of my project showed that the height and position of the sign made a difference. I compared the average speed of vehicles from 4 days last year 2020 with the results from the same 4 days this year 2021 and the speed difference was about 1.17 mph slower when the sign was higher and in a different position.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
