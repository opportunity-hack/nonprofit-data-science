Grade:

Teacher:
MariAnn Slater

1.The purpose of my project is to figure out shampoo makes sheep wool the whitest. 
2. I chose this project because I am in 4H and I wanted to see which soap makes the sheep wool the whitest. 
3. The result of my experiment was the whitening shampoo worked the best. 
4. My project is important because it will help other 4H kids know which shampoo they should use on show days.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
