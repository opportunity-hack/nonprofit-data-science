Hello I am a new eighth grader at Borman K 8 school district. For my science fair project 2021, I choose to test whether different types of music influences how well you sleep and if you would still wake up on time. Music is a language that everyone can understand in there own way. Sleeping is one of my favorite hobbies so I thought this project would be perfect. I spent 11 nights testing my idea.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
