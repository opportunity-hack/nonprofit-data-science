An air powered car

The problem I’m trying to solve is that we are running low on fossil fuel so I’m trying to make a balloon powered car. The burning of fossil fuels also pollutes the environment. I went with air power because I thought it would be possible, unlike making a car that runs on water, seems kind of iffy on the possibility of it working. I felt like it would be difficult to do electricity as a science fair project because I would have to find stuff that powered the car and made the wheels turn with electricity. I felt like it would be too difficult to do. In conclusion it is possible to make a car run off a balloon as a
power source. If I were to repeat it I would make sure the tires weren’t wobbly. Because in my first test, the car went straight, but in the second test the car went sideways.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
