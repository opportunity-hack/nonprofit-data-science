1.This project is about finding/ measuring accuracy and precision in NERF dart types. 
2. I chose this project because I love to play with Nerf toys and always practice with targets
3. The conclusion was that the accustrike darts were the best
4. It is important so that people can understand which darts to buy.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Looks like I'll be buying Accustrike darts to refill our nerf guns. (at least for me ;D)  Nice job. I hope you had fun with this project!
