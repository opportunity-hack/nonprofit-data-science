This project is the study of how the Hohokam tribes of Arizona communicated in long distances by using petroglyphs as the main evidence. I chose this project mainly because of Arizona's history as well as the importance of petroglyphs, and how Native American  tribes symbolized Arizona. The results of this project was leading to the fact that the tribes used to communicate with each other, which in tern lead to the project being successful. I found out how the Hohokam tribes used petroglyphs to symbolize the events happening in their world. The focus of the petroglyphs is to see how they were similar, and how they were a different type of petroglyph that were unique. This project stands importance of how the Native American tribes of Southern Arizona showed the petroglyphs of their kind. It shows some of the history of Arizona, and its natives that lived here.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

glyphs are such an interesting thing we have here in AZ.  I hope you do continue to explore even more relationships here around Az and beyond. :)
