Hello today I will be talking about the reacting time when someone is using there phone, but before this begins I'd like to talk about why I'm doing this, so let me explain. I got this idea by when my sister was using her phone and I called out to her and she didn’t respond until about 30 seconds later, that’s crazy, this ended up giving me the idea to see how long it would take till someone responded to you when using there phone, my goal is to show people that a phone
can have a big effect on our mind when seeing that where in the real world and that we can't react to it slowly.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
