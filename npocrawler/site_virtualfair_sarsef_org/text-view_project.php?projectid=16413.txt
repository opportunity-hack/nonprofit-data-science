Our project was about testing plant growth by manipulating the elements that plants needed to grow. We chose this project because it spoke to our love of plants and gardening. In the end, we found out that water is the most important element to a plant’s survival and growth and that fertilizer/nutrition of soil was the least vital. Our project determined which element should take the highest priority when growing plants.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
