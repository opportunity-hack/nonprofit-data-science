My science fair project is about humans affecting aquatic life in creeks. I am interested in this subject because I have done a lot of projects like it, and they have all been creeks. My hypothesis was that humans cause harm to the creeks. I came up with this hypothesis because humans have made a bad impact on nature so I thought that it would be the same for creeks. I found my results by observing sites and samples. Then I made graphs to show the results. Then I found out that my hypothesis was wrong! If I were to do a future study I would look at other things impacting creeks.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

I like how you described both the macro and micro scale of life you observed at each location.
This is very well done! Super interesting and thorough.
What an interesting question!  Great job discussing your surprising results.
I was very impressed with the construction and implementation of your experiment.  This is an important subject and you did a wonderful job!
