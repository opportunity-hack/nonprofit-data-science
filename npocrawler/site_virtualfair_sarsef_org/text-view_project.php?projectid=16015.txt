How Different Storage Temperatures Affect Battery Strength

My project was on battery voltage and if different storage temperatures would affect the voltage. The purpose of this experiment is to see what storage temperature people should store their batteries. Batteries are used for a lot of things in daily life. Including, flashlights, remote controls, fans, etc. I did this experiment to test which storage temperature would raise the voltage and make the batteries last longer. I believe that if batteries are stored at a colder temperature that the voltage would rise and they would last longer because in the cold the batteries could recharge but in warmer/hotter temperatures may ignite the batteries. My results showed that the temperature did not change much. They stayed the same throughout most of the experiment. These results could have been different if I would have left them in longer or started my experiment earlier. These results are important to show how long you need to leave the batteries at this certain temperature or even to show that certain temperatures don’t change the batteries much at all.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
