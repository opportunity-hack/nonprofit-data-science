HS-EN002
The Effect of Total Watt Withdrawal on the Efficiency of a Power Strip
Energy and Environmental Engineering

My project is about the effect of the amount electricity in watts taken on the efficiency of a power strip's ability to charge electronics. I did this project, because I was interested in how I could make my everyday devices charge the fastest, because I drain them easily and use a power strip to replenish them a lot. Overall, I found that increased energy usually decreased charging time the most when it was near 197 watts with three devices charging. This project is important, because COVID-19 has made it harder to pay energy bills through unemployment and poverty, and power strips are increasing in demand in the global market, so I wanted to find a way to use a power strip in the fastest way while also saving the most energy to reduce energy bill costs.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
