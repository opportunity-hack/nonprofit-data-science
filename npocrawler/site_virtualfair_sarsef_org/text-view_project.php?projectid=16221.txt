Winning or Losing With More Video Game Time During COVID?

Jessica Reichling Class
Grade:
4

Teacher:
Jessica Reichling

We measured participants' feelings after they played video games for an extended period of time. The students were very excited to try to learn the outcome of this experiment. Our conclusion was that individuals should play video games no longer than 15 minutes at a time. Our project is important because COVID has increased the amount of time that individuals are indoors playing video games.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
