They say an apple a day keeps the doctor away. Our beloved apples are full of vitamins. Unfortunately, they also have the tendency to turn brown very quickly after being sliced. Oxidation can be avoided by covering the fruit with ascorbic acid. Ascorbic acid is another word for vitamin C. Vitamin C can be found in many citrus fruits like oranges, grapefruits, lemon, and limes.  If we can prevent oxidation from occurring, we can enjoy our pre-cut fruit and leftover fruit salad, we will never have to worry about brown fruit again!
This project has been cleared by SRC.
