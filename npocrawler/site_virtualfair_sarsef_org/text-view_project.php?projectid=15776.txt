My project is about a fork that can use an electronic pulse , sense an e-coli and inform the user if the food is good or bad. I choose this project because I got food poisoning and it was the worst so I really DON'T want to go through that again. I wanted to make a fork that would help prevent food poisoning.  In conclusion The Food Detective will be able to find an e-coli within food and be able to send the user a clear, safe message. This will prevent anyone from getting food poisoning ever again! I believe my project is important because it can help stop a big health problem with an easy use item. "
This project has been cleared by SRC.
