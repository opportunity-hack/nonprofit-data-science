Water Cycle! How Evaporation & Condensation Work
Earth and Environmental Sciences

Grade:
3

Teacher:
Mabel Rivera

I wanted to see how CO2 affects evaporation. . We are doing 4 experiments inside bottles with plants, soil, CO2 and water. Different amounts of CO2 affects how the plants thrive. I am interested in seeing what may happen with global warming and having more CO2 in the system. It is important for us to know what may happen in the future.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

I really liked this project! For a third grade, this was a complex set up. You did a great job of recording your data and showing it a way that is easily understood. Keep thinking like a scientist!
Excellent project with on a complex subject.  You did a great job!
