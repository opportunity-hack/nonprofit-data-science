The Effect of Temperature on the Rate of Osmosis
Animal and Plant Sciences

Grade:
5

Teacher:
Paige Riedy

The project is about investigating the affect of temperature on the rate of osmosis. I chose this project because osmosis is crucial for many biological systems. My overall conclusion is that temperature enhances the rate of osmosis. My project is important to understand how osmosis is different in plants during different seasons.
This project has been cleared by SRC.


Comments

Your drawing with the colored dots really helped me understand osmosis. Good job making sure to have consistency with egg size, etc. Consistency is very important
Well done experiment and good results.
