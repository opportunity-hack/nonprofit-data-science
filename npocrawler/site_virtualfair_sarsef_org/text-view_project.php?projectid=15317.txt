HS-BE003
Effects of Waking Life Events and Personality on Continuity and Attitude Towards Dreams
Behavioral and Social Science

Ashley Shi
Grade:
HS

Teacher:
Elyse Wexler

My research is about dream and sleep psychology, most specifically about how waking life events, behaviors, and opinions affect an individual’s dream and sleep patterns. I chose this project because I have always been curious about how dreams may be impacted by the events I experience throughout life and what kinds of factors affect the dreams that individuals have. My conclusion was that dream recall frequency can be influenced by age and opinion towards dreams. I also found that there are certain personality traits and behaviors that affect opinion towards dreams. My project is important because it shows how the events individuals experience can positively or negatively impact dream and sleep patterns. While people will usually not think much about their dreams and sleep, it can be beneficial to record one’s dreams to find patterns or connections between dreams and waking life events.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
