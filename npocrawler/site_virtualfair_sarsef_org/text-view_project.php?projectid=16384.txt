My project is about how plants are affected by tones of voices. I choose this project because I've been wanting to grow some daisies and I was inspired by the rice experiment; I saw a few monthes back on Social Media. My result was that plants are affected by tone of voices, the plants I gave hate to died, the love plants lived and the ignored went both ways. My project is important because of its meaning, giving hate to people/things can affect them in negative ways, but giving love can help them become something beautiful.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Seems as if we all, plants and people, thrive in a positive environment.  Great project, Thanks!
