Mighty Muffins! Kitchen Chemistry
Chemical Sciences

Pamela Buchanan Class
Grade:
5

Teacher:
Pamela Buchanan

Students will see how varying the amount of baking powder in a muffin recipe affects the outcome of the final product.   Making muffins (or other baked goods) can also be a fun way to learn some kitchen chemistry.  It is interesting to see how the goopy batter gets transformed in the oven into a perfect, minature cake with a golden brown top.  It was a great treat for dinner or lunch!
This project has been cleared by SRC.
