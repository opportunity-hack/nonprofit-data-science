I was testing witch kills bacteria faster UV light or hand sanitizer. I chose this project because with Covid, I wanted to text witch kills bacteria the fastest. The conclusion is hand sanitizer killed bacteria the best that I could see. This project is important by testing how well different materials killed Bactria the best.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

What a great topical (and gross) experiment! How long did the UV treated bacteria not grow? That was an interesting finding as well. As you point out, with Covid around, we need any help we can get!
