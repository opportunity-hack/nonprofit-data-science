This time of year in Southern Arizona we all need to clean up our messy patios and spruce up our yards for springtime! This requires a person to clean up the mess. I am modifying an electric leaf blower to be remote controlled and easier/fun for cleaning up messes. Figuring out the design was very challenging as well as finding the right kind of RC vehicle that could support the leaf blower and have enough power.  The prototype did work well and was fun. It needs to have a better trigger holder that will stay in place and not slip. It also needs a bit more stabilization during fast acceleration.
