HS-EN003
Desalination and Purification of Tainted Salt Water
Energy and Environmental Engineering

1. My project is about the desalination and purification of tainted saltwater. I chose this project because I wanted to create a way people can produce safe drinkable water in their own backyard while being cost-efficient. The result of this project is that the water came out desalinated and purified. My project is important because if it is conducted at a larger scale, people in low-income areas and people with little access to water can be provided with safe drinkable water.

Keywords: Desalination, purification, tainted, saltwater, cheap
This project has been cleared by SRC.
