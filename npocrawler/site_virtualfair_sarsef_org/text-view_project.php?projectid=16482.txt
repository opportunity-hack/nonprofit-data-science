Tie Dye T-shirts

Grade:

Teacher:
Mrs. Harakal

We wanted to know if fruits and vegetables could dye shirts. We chose this project because we thought it would be cool to try and tie dye using food. We found out that blueberries worked really well. Our project was important because food is safe for kids to use to dye things.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
