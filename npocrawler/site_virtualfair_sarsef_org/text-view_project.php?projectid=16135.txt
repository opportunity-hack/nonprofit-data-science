My project is about the senses. I chose this because when a person got Covid19, they lost some of their senses (taste and smell). So I wanted to see how other things affected the senses (blindfold, nose plugs). My result was the blindfold heightening taste  by just a little. I believe this could be important (especially today). What if you got Covid19 and lost your taste and smell. Who knows, a blindfold could bring them back, even if it's just a bit.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
