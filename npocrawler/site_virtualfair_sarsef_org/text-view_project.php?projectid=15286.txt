Wait! Don't Touch Your Face!

Janine Malkin Class
Grade:
5

Teacher:
Janine Malkin

We observed students and adults in a remote class environment to determine how many times they touched their hands to their faces, and hair in a 15 minute period. With all the research and public recommendations for washing hands and keeping hands off our faces to help decrease transmission of the virus--and with a potential for going back to in-person school. We wanted to get a feel for the problem and quantify how often students and teachers actually touch their faces in the first place.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
