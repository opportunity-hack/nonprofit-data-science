For my project I wanted to design a way for my chickens to eat
fresh plants while staying safe in the coop while also conserving water. My project was successful because I built a planter out of recycled materials, using a reservoir and dripper system for slow watering, and my chickens happily peck at the plants through the fence without becoming prey.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Very creative problem solving!
Great project
Excellent problem solving plan!  The drawing you did
reflects the work you actually did.  Well done.
Do the plants grow fast enough so the chickens have a steady
supply?  Can you tell if the chickens health is improved?
I like how you refined the design to make your system work.
