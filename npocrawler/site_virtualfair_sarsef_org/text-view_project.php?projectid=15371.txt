Got Milk! Turning Milk Into Bioplastic

Grade:

Teacher:
Mrs. Mitchell

Plastics have a big impact on the planet. I am going to test which milk bioplastic is the most durable. I will do this by making milk plastic with milk with different fat percentages and testing them in everyday activities to see which would be a realistic plastic alternative.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

I never had seen a experiment like this! I am impressed! This is a very cool experiment that you conducted!
Wow! I didn't know that you could make plastic out of milk. I like all of the little items you made, especially the minifigure molds. Good real world solution!
