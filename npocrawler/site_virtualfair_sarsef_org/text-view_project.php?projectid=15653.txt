HS-EN005
Solar Powered Car vs. Environments
Energy and Environmental Engineering

Grade:
HS

project is about the effect environments have on the solar powered car I built.
I chose the project because i found it fun to build the car and interesting to learn about solar energy.
Overall the different environments had effects on the solar powered car.
I feel my project was important because in the near future we might move forward toward energy powered/solar vehicles.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
