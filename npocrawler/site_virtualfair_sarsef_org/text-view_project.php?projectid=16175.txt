My project was about the effect of flows of propane and different cymatic frequencies on the standing flame of a Rubens tube. I chose this project because I was fascinated by cymatic frequencies and their ability to create waves and patterns in materials. My result was a big effect of the flows of propane and different frequencies on the standing flames. My project is important because it shows us how sound frequencies look and work within a substance such as propane flames.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
