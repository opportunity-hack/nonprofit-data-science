HS-CM006
The Feasibility of the Extraction of (2E)-3-phenylprop-2-enal from Cinnamomum cassia Bark Using Water and Aqueous Ethanol as Solvents in Distillation
Chemical and Material Science

1) My project is about investigating if traditional methods of steam distillation can be made more efficient by using aqueous ethanol (25% and 50%) as the distillation solvent rather than pure water.
2) I chose this project because as a future engineer, I am interested in exploring ways to reduce the production cost of substances, such as cinnamaldehyde, which are used in the industry.
3) My overall conclusion is that aqueous ethanol will not yield a more efficient distillation process due to changes in the vapor pressure of the liquid mixture.
4) My project is important because it may help guide future research in creating more efficient extraction processes, which in turn could reduce production costs.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
