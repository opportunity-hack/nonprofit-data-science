Mandi Cordell Class
Grade:
4

Teacher:
Mandi Cordell

This school year has been very different for our class. With the pandemic going on we have spent most of our school year learning remotely from home. Right now it has been more important than ever to keep learning, growing and helping each other. We decided to try many different activities to stay connected to each other. Through this investigation we learned we do have online tools we can use that are both engaging and interesting. We will continue to use these tools to grow this year whether we are in person or learning remotely because we are stronger together!
This project has been cleared by SRC.
