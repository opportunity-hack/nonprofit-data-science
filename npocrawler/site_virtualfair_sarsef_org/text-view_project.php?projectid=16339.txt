What Effect Does Makeup Have on Society?
Behavioral and Social Science

Bethany Crowl
Grade:
8

Teacher:
Sang Lee

My project was about finding out if makeup has an effect in different students. I chose this project because I love makeup and I wanted to see if it had an effect. My result was overall that it does have an effect on social situations. This project is important because people should know that makeup can affect certain situation.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
