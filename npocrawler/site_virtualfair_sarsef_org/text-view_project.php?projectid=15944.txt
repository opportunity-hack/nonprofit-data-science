Melting Chocolate Everywhere
Chemical Sciences

Melting Chocolate Everywhere is about determining if dark, milk, or white chocolate melts the fastest.  I chose this project because I love chocolate and cooking as a type of chemical science sounded interesting.  The results of Melting Chocolate Everywhere is that white chocolate melted the fastest, dark chocolate was the second fastest, and then milk chocolate.   This project is important because it will help you make decisions when baking and making candy with chocolate on which type to use, as well as how long it will need to be cooked or heated.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
