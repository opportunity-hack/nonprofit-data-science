Inspired by a problem facing our school, researched to figure out a way to incorporate Raspberry Pi technology with added motion sensor, strobe light, and a day and night sensor to record after midnight. When activated, the timed motion sensor would set off a strobe light to scare off farmyard predators including; Bobcats and Coyotes. Turned out that all of the components I needed either had to be paired with another item in order to function and the added parts were too expensive for me to buy. Even though I really enjoy programming in languages like Scratch and Python, after all of my research, I realized what I was trying to accomplish had to be programmed in a way I am still unfamiliar or were just not available for me to learn about to figure out. After all of the time I spent figuring out a way to set this up, I came across an actual product on Amazon. :-/ There's already a product on the market that is affordable and does exactly what I was trying to do on my own for less than $40. It was then I realized, I should have done more background research in the beginning. I was really mad when I came across it but I did learn a lot about various coding programs and how to integrate systems with coding.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
