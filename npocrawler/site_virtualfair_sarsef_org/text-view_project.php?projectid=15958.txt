Building Our Community - Literally
Health and Wellness

Niki Tilicki Class
Grade:
5

Teacher:
Niki Tilicki

Building a community during a pandemic is not easy. We held a building challenge at our school to see if we could change the way our community interacts. We had 85% of our families participate and believe that our world is more together and brighter!
This project has been cleared by SRC.
