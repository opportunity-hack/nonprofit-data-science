For my project I designed an electric back massager. I wanted to design this product to be comfortable and reach places that you cannot with just your hands. The final prototype is the cotton ball back massager because it felt the best. The cotton ball can massage by the motor spinning. The motor spins because it is powered by the battery. My project is important because it can help people relax and solve muscle pain.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
