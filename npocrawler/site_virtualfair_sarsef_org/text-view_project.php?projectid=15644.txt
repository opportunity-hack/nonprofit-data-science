Which Natural Process Slows Down Decomposition Best?
Earth and Environmental Science

Lea Layton, Megan L Lujan
Grade:
7

Teacher:
Mr. Greg Gaines

We want to find a better way to slow down decomposition of dead bodies while trying to use natural resources. We chose this project because the chemicals that are currently being used to embalm dead bodies is slowly killing the earth. We found that burying bananas that represented dead bodies naturally is the best way to decompose bodies but using wax makes the skin stronger. Our project is important because by getting rid of these chemicals, we can slowly start making the environment more natural.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Good work! Creative project!
What a great project! I have never considered the effects that embalming has on the environment. You have introduced a great topic for discussion in an area where improvements can be made.
Great Project - thank you for looking for ways to improve our impact on the environment!
Creative and thoughtful use of science! Looks like you learned a lot before, during and after your experiment! Keep learning!
