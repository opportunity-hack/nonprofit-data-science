My project is about finding out which battery, out of Duracell, Rayovac, and Energizer, lasts the longest. 

I chose this project because it is substantial to my life, and my family because I/we never know which brand to buy at the store.

My result and overall conclusion showed Duracell with 2 hours and 10 minutes, lasting the longest, because it had more alkaline than others. 

My project is important because it can be helpful to others, substantial to the world. I would like to know which battery is the best, and now I do, it's Durcell.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
