Plastic Bag Reuse

Ken Kratzer

The project took plastic bags from the store and created a reusable bag. This project was chosen to find a way to reuse the bags instead of throwing them away.  It was possible to make a reusable bag that can hold 19 pounds. This is important to help recycle materials rather than throw them away to help our planet.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Wow, I really like this idea. I've collected so many plastic bags during the pandemic and I've wondered what to do with them. Maybe you could turn this into a business!
