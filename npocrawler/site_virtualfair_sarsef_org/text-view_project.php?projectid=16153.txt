Avian Relationships to Cottonwood (Populus fremontii) in Perennial vs Intermittent Riparian Ecosystems in Southern Arizona

Dr. Mark Saliba

Cottonwood trees are important for avian diversity, as are riparian areas in the Southwest.  This study compared observed avian diversity between two locations in Pima County, Agua Caliente Park (having a perennial water source) and Cienega Creek Natural Preserve (having an intermittent water source).  It was found that Cienega Creek Natural Preserve had higher observed avian diversity in relation to cottonwood trees.  Results of this study, along with further research regarding compositional and structural differences, could determine factors contributing to the difference in diversity between the two locations.
Keywords: Riparian, avian, diversity, cottonwood

Comments

Your research does a great job confirming the need to protect riparian areas for bird diversity.
Excellent work. Is cottonwood the only changing factor in these two areas?  Did you consider the length of Cienega Creek, vs. the urban pond?  What other vegetation is in each?
