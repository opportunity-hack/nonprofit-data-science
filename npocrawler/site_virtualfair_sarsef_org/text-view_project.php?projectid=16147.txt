My invention is a hat that keeps you cool. It has sponges that are soaked in rubbing alcohol and water and frozen that stick on the inside of the hat. I chose this project because I like to wear hats but they sometimes make my head hot in the desert heat. My hat solves the problem of your head getting hot while your wearing a hat. Overall, my hats works. The sponges are soft and flexible while you wear them because of the rubbing alcohol but they still freeze a little bit. My project is important because many people work in the summer in Arizona and it is really hot here. This will help them stay cool.
