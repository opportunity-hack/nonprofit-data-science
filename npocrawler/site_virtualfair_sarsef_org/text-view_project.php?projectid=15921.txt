1. What is your project about?
My project is about me trying to figure out if face masks affect your O2 saturation levels.
2. Why did you choose this project?
I chose this project because my parents are doctors.
3. What was your result/overall conclusion?
There was no huge difference in your O2 levels if you wore a mask or not.
4. Why is your project important?
My project is important because it is good to let everybody know that masks do not affect your
overall health.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
