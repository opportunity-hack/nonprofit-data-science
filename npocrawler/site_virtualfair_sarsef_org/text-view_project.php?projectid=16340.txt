Teacher:
MariAnn Slater

1.The purpose of my project is to figure out what type of detergent kills the most bacteria.
2. I chose this project because we all have to wear masks now and I want to make sure we are cleaning them correctly. 
3. The result of my experiment is ALL killed the most bacteria on average. 
4. My project is important because it keeps us all safer by knowing which detergent works best at killing the most bacteria.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
