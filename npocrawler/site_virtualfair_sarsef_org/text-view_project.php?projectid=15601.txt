HS-AS007
Investigation on Amino Acid DL-Phenylalanine’s Ability as a Cognitive Stimulant in V. costata

This project is a continuation of research done in 2019 where I tested a homeopathic repellent (magnets) on grass snails (V. costata). With the knowledge that these snails are in fact repelled by magnetic force, I tested whether or not supplementing Phenylalanine (free form DL-Phe is a mixture of both artificially and naturally synthesized amino acid) would positively impact cognitive awareness, enough to quicken the rate at which snails displace themselves from magnetic force. However, my results showed almost the opposite of what I had predicted: instead of moving in the direction opposite of a central magnet in the behavior chamber, the Phe-supplemented snails found refuge on top of and around the magnet. One major difference between this year's collected observations and last year's is that about 20% of the sampled snails were dormant and did not move at all. Like other southwestern snail species, V. costata can become invasive and deter agricultural endeavors. My findings are one step closer to understanding the hibernation patterns of grass snails and how humans can take advantage of such patterns to optimize agricultural output without harming these wonderful creatures.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

I really like that you are motivated to solve a problem that you and others are having with snails in your garden! Good luck
