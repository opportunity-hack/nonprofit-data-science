Why Do Cats Like Boxes?

Do you like watching cats play in boxes? There are lots of ideas about why cats like boxes so much. I have three cats that I decided to test what made them like to get into a box.Cats likes to be in boxes for lots of reasons, even big cats like tigers (Big Cat Rescue 2021). It allows them to hide but still look around, and they might prefer either a high place or a low place (Trotman 2018).
My hypothesis was right that, overall, the cats would like the window boxes better, and also that they would like the big boxes better, but I was wrong that they would like the high boxes better.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

I love watching cats play in boxes too! Thanks for testing which boxes cats like better.
I did not know we could create an experiment to determine what cats like about boxes. This is a very informative and thorough experiment.
This is one of the best projects I've seen yet! Very good question that I've always asked myself yet have never thought of testing. Thank you for taking this matter into your own hands.
Cats in boxes are the cutest!  I would never have thought to figure out which box they would like best - this is a great experiment!  I love that you're curious and test it out to find an answer.
I thought all the cats would like the high boxes, this is so cool. I learned so much, Great job!
I   love   cats   playing    in   box   thanks.!
