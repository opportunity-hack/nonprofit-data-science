HS-EA025
The Effect of Weather Forecasting Methods on the Accuracy of Forecasts
Earth and Environmental Science

Hannah Jackson
Grade:
HS

Teacher:
Elyse Wexler

This project is about different weather forecasting methods, and whether they differ in accuracy when compared to the Numerical Weather Prediction. This project was chosen because of an interest in weather. The overall conclusion was that there is a difference in each method's accuracy when compared to the NWP. This project is important because it could help improve existing methods and/or help create new and more precise ones. 
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Looks like you had fun using the weather tools and data. Maybe you can be the one to get those predictions more accurate in the future.
