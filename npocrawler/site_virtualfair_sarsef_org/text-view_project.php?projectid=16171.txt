My science project is about how building materials that are used in homes have an effect on a Wi-Fi signal. I chose this project because I am interested in the functionality of Wi-Fi, and because of my family's experience with Wi-Fi during the pandemic. I concluded that metal, when surrounding a wifi router, had the greatest negative impact on a Wi-Fi signal using dBm as the measurement. This is a useful project because of the growing importance of Wi-Fi in homes throughout the world.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
