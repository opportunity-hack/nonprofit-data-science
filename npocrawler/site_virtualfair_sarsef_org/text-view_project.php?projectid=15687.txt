Whenever I play outside I can see lots of different kinds of birds. I see red birds and yellow birds and gray birds. Some birds are big and some birds are tiny.  I wanted to learn more about the birds I see around my home.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Very cool seeing how many different kinds of birds would play around your home. I'm jealous!
I love this project because I love to watch birds and glad you are getting started with this hobby.  Good counting of the birds and graphs, too.
Wow, very interesting thought
I love this project! It is really cute and important because it helps bring awareness to our natural wildlife.
I liked your project. I like birds too.
