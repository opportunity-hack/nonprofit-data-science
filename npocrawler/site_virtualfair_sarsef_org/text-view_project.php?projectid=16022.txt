Which Desert Plant Reduces Carbon Dioxide and Temperature the Most?

My project is about "Which Desert Plants Reduce the Temperature
and Carbon Dioxide the most". I chose this project because I wanted to do something on the environment and a way to help it and planting the plants that reduce temperature and Carbon Dioxide is one way to help the environment. I found out that the Creosote reduced the most Carbon Dioxide and the Scarlet Hedgehog reduced the most temperature. My project is important because if you plant more Scarlet hedgehog cacti, and more creosote bushes than you are helping stop Climate Change, and even if it is just a little, a little can go a long way.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Love that you found a great science fair project right in your back yard! Nice job taking multiple samples and averaging to help eliminate  measurement issues. I'm going to add creosote to my yard!
Nice Job.
Congratulations on your $50 Environmental Impact Award for excellent research that can help Tucson mitigate climate change!
Interesting idea to compare these plants and you must have learned a lot about different testing techniques in the process.  Hope you continue to be curious and creative
