Due to the drought in Arizona, the water flow was reduced in the Salt River.This reduction exposed the plants the horse herds eat. The Salt River Horse Management Group are now having to supplemental feed the wild horses. I am designing a hay feeder so the wild herd won’t get used to human contact. The “Feral Feeder” will reduce the number of times volunteers need to feed the wild horses.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

I love this
Great job explaining the issue. Great research!
Amazing idea! I wish I could have seen your sketches for your other designs.
Great project! I love that your slides are very clear and easy to read. It's great that these horses have somebody really looking out for them! Keep up the good work!
