What Colors Are Dogs Attracted To?
Animal and Plant Science

Milka Figueroa
Grade:

MariAnn Slater

1. The purpose of this experiment was to test a dog's color vision in order to find their
color preference.
2. I chose this project because as a dog owner I've always been very interested in dogs and
their color vision plays a very important role in their life that not only answers several
of my questions about dog behaviors but it also gives me an idea of a new way to train
my dog.
3. My results showed that my dog was attracted to the color yellow more times than any
of the other color samples.
4. This project is important because it gives information about a dog's color vision and
can help both researchers and dog owners have more knowledge of how colors can
influence a dog's behavior.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
