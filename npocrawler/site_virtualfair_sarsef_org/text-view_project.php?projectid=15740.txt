My project is about testing different printer filaments to see which one is best. I tested it against heat resistance, stringing, durability, print quality and usability. I wanted to do this experiment because I love 3d printing. It is important to choose a high quality filament for a better print. My results were not what I expected. The PENG filament proved to be the best overall. This project is important because it will show people what filament has the best all-around performance.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
