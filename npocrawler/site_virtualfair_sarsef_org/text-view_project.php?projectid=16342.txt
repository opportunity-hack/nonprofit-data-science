5-CH035
Mummification of Hot Dogs
Chemical Sciences

Angelo Campbell, Elias J. Tapia
Grade:
5

Teacher:
Jennine Grogan

Project was to determine when using hot dogs of different types would it make a difference in the mummification process. We chose this project because it allowed us to learn about mummification and Egypt. It also taught us about the natural process of mummification. The project is important because it teaches us about how to preserve bodies and other objects but also that the earth has a natural process and chemicals that can do it naturally.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Great lesson learned, replications are important! Good job.
It was great to talk to you about your project.  Even though it didn't turn out how you wanted
you learned a lot and were able to do science with a friend.
You did great during your interview! Keep being curious and asking questions!
Great work! Mummification is so interesting. Who would have thought you can mummify a hotdog?!
