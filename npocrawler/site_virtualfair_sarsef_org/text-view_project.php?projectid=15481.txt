For our project we designed booties for our dog. When we take our dog for a walk, he always gets burrs in his front paws and on the fur on his legs because we live in the desert and there are many weeds along our road. The burrs then need to be removed from his fur and he does not like when we pick the burrs out. We have not found any booties in the store that cover our dog’s front legs so we successfully designed a bootie that kept burrs out of our dog’s paws and fur! We can now enjoy our family walks with our dog.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Wow - very creative and you solved a real-world problem!  I'm sure you and your dog are very happy with the design of the bootie!  (From one dog owner to another.)
I love your idea to make boots for dogs so they don't get burs stuck in there paws! -Christine J
Cool making your idea a reality. We love that you helped your dog with it.
