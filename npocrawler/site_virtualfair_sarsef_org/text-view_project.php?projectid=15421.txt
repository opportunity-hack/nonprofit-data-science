What is your project about?
My project is about how the surrounding temperature affects a human’s heart rate when exercising.



Why did you choose this project?
I had joined the weight training class at my school, and I was interested in how I could make my heart rate change, even when doing the same exercise.


What was your result/overall conclusion?
My conclusion was that exercising in hotter temperatures increases heart rate significantly.


Why is your project important?
My project can help people get more value from their exercise. By simply exercising outside, (if you live in a hot area) you could reach your optimal heart rate faster.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
