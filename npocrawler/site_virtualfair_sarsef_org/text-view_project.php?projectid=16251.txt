How to Recharge in a Pandemic
Health and Wellness

Theresa Chavez Class
Grade:
6

Teacher:
Theresa Chavez

Can the things we do before we sleep help us sleep during stressful times, Many students are struggling to sleep because of the stress and change in routines and healthy habits we have had to adopt to combat the Corona Virus Pandemic. Our project showed that pre-sleep behaviors can have a positive effect on the quality of sleep we experience the next day. This is important because many students are struggling with stress during the pandemic and children require sleep to be healthy.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
