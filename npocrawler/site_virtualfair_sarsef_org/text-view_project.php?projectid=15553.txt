Does the Color of Food Affect Whether People Will Eat It or Not?

For my science fair project, I tested if the color of food affects whether people would eat it or not. To do this, I decided to get 5 pieces of plain white bread and color them red, brown, blue, and green. I also left one piece of bread uncolored for a constant. I chose these colors because they were the ones that I found to have the most reactions in my research. My hypothesis was that the warmer colored breads such as the normal one, red, and brown, would get more votes than the cooler colored breads of blue and green. I was inspired to do this because of one of my old science projects that dealt with color psychology.  When I looked back on that project and researched on the topic a bit more, I became interested in it again and wanted to expand on it. To carry out my project, I went on IbisPaint x, took pictures of white bread, and colored them red, brown, blue, and green. Then, I lined all the colors up in a row and made a rating system for them. Finally, I sent a picture of it to my participants and got their ratings. After getting all the results back, I found out that the normal colored bread was the most desired which was then followed with a tie between red and brown, then blue and green.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
