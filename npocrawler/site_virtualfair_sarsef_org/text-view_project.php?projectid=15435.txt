Exercise:  Are You In or Out?

My project is about the most effective environment to exercise.  I chose this project because when gyms closed during the pandemic and people had to workout at home, I wanted to know the best place to do my exercise.  My overall conclusion was that I got the most intense workout from exercising in the park and exercising in the house was the least effective.  My project is important because we have had to change many behaviors during the pandemic.  Many people have started to workout in their houses or backyards, but this is not the only or best option.  With schools being closed and children missing out on P.E, problems such as obesity and mental health challenges may get worse so it is important to know the best way to work out.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

This was a great project.  It also made me wonder if our oxygen intake level is higher when we exercise outside.  Fresh air always does a body good!
