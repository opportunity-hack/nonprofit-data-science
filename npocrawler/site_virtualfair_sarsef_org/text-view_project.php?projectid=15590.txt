1. My project is about whether you can use baking soda and vinegar to clean clothes or do you need to use laundry detergent, (what works best). 
2. I chose to do this project because I know that a lot of people can't afford big expensive bottles of laundry detergent, so I decided to test which would work best to clean clothes. 
3.My result was that the laundry detergent did work best, but the baking soda and vinegar solution still works quite well.
4.My project is important because I was able to find out if laundry detergent is actually necessary, and if we really don't need it.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
