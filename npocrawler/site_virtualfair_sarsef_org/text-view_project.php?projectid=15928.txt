Do you want to know the best way to get rid of weeds? 
My dad is always bugging me to help get rid of weeds in the backyard. I am determined to find the perfect way to get rid of weeds so that I do not have to pick the weeds up as a chore.  
I am going to run an experiment to see which weed killer works the best.  Most Weed killers are not safe for me to use . I would like to know if homemade weed killer with safer ingredients work as well?  
I also hope it will make it easier for kids to do this chore and help adults by saving their money. This is an Eco Friendly recipe.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
