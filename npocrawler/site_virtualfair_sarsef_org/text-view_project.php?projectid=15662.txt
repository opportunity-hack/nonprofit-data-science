What Structure Can Hold a Bag of Candy?

My project is about what structure can hold up a bag of candy. I picked three structures which were an arch, a cube and a pyramid. I then had to build the structures and I had to make sure they were all stable. The cube came in 2nd place as it did hold up the bag of candy but it started to sink down a little bit when I put the candy bag on it. The arch came in third place as it did not hold up the bag of candy at all even though it had two support beams. Finally, the pyramid was the official winner as it held the weight of the candy bag. However, my hypothesis was correct; the pyramid was the one to hold up the candy bag better. This was not an easy project even though it would seem that it is an easy project. You have to make sure there is a supported base for each structure and it has to be able to stand up. One of these structures were able to achieve this and it was the pyramid. In conclusion, this was a fun and not so easy project to do. I learned many things about structures and organization. I recommend that if someone wants to be a engineer but start with smaller structures this is a project to do.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
