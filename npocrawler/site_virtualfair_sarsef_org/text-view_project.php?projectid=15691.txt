Ant Behaviors in Isolation
Animal and Plant Science

Hope Ramsook, Camila Rivera-Arteaga
Grade:
8

Teacher:
Nicole Rangel

Our project is about putting ants in isolation to see the behaviors to that environment. We chose this project because Camila had ants when she was younger and there were some behaviors that she wanted to test out and we found the idea of how organisms react while in isolation interesting. Our result was that some ants were able to stay in isolation longer than others before they started to show signs of major distress. Most ants tried to escape their container and two succeeded. This project is important because, it helps show sighs of distress in both ants and humans, and to also see if ants have human emotions. Also, this project shows that if we see signs of distress in humans we can be able to help them.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
