In my project I test which of the three muscles (biceps, triceps, and flexor carpi ulnaris) is the most sensitive to electrical stimuli. I chose this project out of inspiration from both my parents, my mom is a nurse and my dad deals with electrical engineering. It turned out that the flexor carpi ulnaris is the most sensitive to electrical stimuli. I believe this project can help with progression with prosthesis.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
