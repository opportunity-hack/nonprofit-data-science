HS-AS013
The Effects of Changing pH on Crustacean Life
Animal Science

Joely Ciasca, Devika Deguzman
Grade:
HS

Teacher:
Elyse Wexler

1. Our project is about testing the range of tolerance for Crustacean species with lower pH levels
2. We chose this project because we love the ocean and all of the creatures in it and we would hate to the beautiful oceanic animals disappear off this earth
3. the results of this project were that crustaceans species could survive in in lower pH levels
4. Our project is important because global warming is the main cause of increasing carbonic acid in the oceans, and that carbonic acid is lowering the pH of the water
This project has been cleared by SRC.
