1. My project is about what materials can block my WiFi signal.
2. I chose this project because I was curious about what would negatively affect my WiFi signal.
3. My project results were that of the 6 materials I chose, none of them had much of an affect on my WiFi signal.
4.The importance of my project is to show what might negatively affect my WiFi signal and in today's world where the internet is so important to all of us, it is good to understand what could negate a strong signal.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
