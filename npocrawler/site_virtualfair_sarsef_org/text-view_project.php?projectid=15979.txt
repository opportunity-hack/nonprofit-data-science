My project examines microplastics in the cosmetic/personal care product of facial exfoliating scrubs.  I chose this project because microplastics and their negative impacts have been a huge topic of debate recently and I started to notice numerous products I use everyday have been said to have microplastics in them. I concluded that almost all of the products I tested had microplastics in them and many had visible beads that are an indication of microplastics. My project is important because microplastics are lightly monitored but have detrimental impacts on humans and the environment, so if microplastics are studied further more regulations may be put in place to reduce the impacts.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
