Do Animals That Live Together Have Similar Behaviors?

"The purpose of this project is to determine if animals who live together, exhibit the same or similar behavior or if their behavior is innate.  I noticed our bird sometimes behaves just like our dogs, especially when there is food around.  I wondered if they behaved the same when I separated them as when they are together.  The bird begs for food when the dogs do.  Is that typical bird behavior or are they following the dogs lead?
