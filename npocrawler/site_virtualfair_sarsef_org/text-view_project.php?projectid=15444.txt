Ramp It Up!
Energy and Environmental Engineering

Janine Malkin Class
Grade:
5

Teacher:
Janine Malkin

To help people who have physical disabilities or challenges, we made models of portable ramps to be used to access buildings with steps to go up or down. The class was interested in designing ramps that could be portable, light weight but sturdy, , and could be stored or set up as easily as possible. We considered the people who would use the ramps, materials, and features useful to someone needing a ramp in making design and redesign choices.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
