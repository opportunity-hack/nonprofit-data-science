Can Plant Waste Materials Extract Fabric Dye from Wastewater?

Mrs. Lara Huetter

The whole world is affected by the problem of water pollution and one-fifth of that is from the textile industry. Color is one of the hardest things to remove from wastewater, impacting photosynthesis and aquatic ecosystems. Plant waste materials were tested to determine if they could lower pH and total dissolved solids, and improve transparency of water polluted with fabric dye. Corn husk improved transparency so future research using it may lead to an inexpensive and sustainable solution.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
