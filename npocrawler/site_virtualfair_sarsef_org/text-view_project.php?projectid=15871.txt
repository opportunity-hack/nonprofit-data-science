This experiment looks at the question: What is the effect of the pH (potential for hydrogen) level on iron absorption in the stomach? I chose this project because I wanted to find out if you are able to absorb iron better on an empty stomach or a full stomach. There is more iron present that absorbed more quickly in an empty stomach.
This will help those who have iron deficiencies know when to take iron supplements.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
