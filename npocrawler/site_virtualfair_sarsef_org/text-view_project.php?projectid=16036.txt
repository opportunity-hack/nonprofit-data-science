Earth and Environmental Science

Grade:

Teacher:
Marisa Kleiman

The project is about ocean pollution and the effects of different pollutants on Artemia (Brine Shrimp). The project was chosen to help raise awareness to people about ocean pollution. The overall conclusion was that out of the 4 pollutants tested that sunscreen was the most negatively affecting hatch rate and mortality rate. This project is important because ocean pollution is killing many sea animals every day and many people don't realize or care.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
