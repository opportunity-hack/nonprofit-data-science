Stopping Styrofoam With Rice and Salt: How Much Salt Does It Take?
Energy and Environmental Engineering

I wanted to find out if a product can be made with materials that does not use paper, that is not harmful to human or animal health, and that will not pollute the environment. Last year I found that when salt was added to rice that it improved the performance of the paper I was making. This project focused on how much salt is needed to create a paper that can perform similarly to Styrofoam but that would dissolve when added to water. I created a total of 10 prototypes, varying the amount of salt, and tested each for durability, strength, and dissolvability. I wanted to find one that would dry flat, without cracks, that did not break easily, would hold more weight than a similar sized plate, and would dissolve slowly. The prototype with Rice+1tbs+tsp of salt passed all of my tests. This engineering project is important because finding a replacement for Styrofoam will help reduce the problems that Styrofoam causes to the environment, to humans and to animals.
This project has been cleared by SRC.


Comments

A very well executed project!
Excellent work!  Impressive that you built this work on last year's results.  Excellent use of
graphs to show results.  Careful variation of ingredients as the variable meant good results.  Your ideas for shaping the rice paper are worth testing.  Well done.
