Composting Over Fertilizer

My project is about using more ecofriendly fertilizer, which will help prevent damage to ecosystems. The ecofriendly fertilizer worked better than the store bought brand. The ecofreindly fertilizer was made out of fruit and vegitable scraps, tea bags, coffee grounds, and soil. This is important because farmers can use this type of fertilizer which is better for ecosystems and cheaper for farmers if they are resuing waste.
This project has been cleared by SRC.


Comments

Composting is a great field of study. I encourage you to experiment more! Did you try comparing your compost plants to conventional fertilizer? If composting wins, you might convince some farmers!
