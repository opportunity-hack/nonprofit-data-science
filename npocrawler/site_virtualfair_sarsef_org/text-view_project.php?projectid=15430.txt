Growing plants and checking if listed sprouting times were accurate.  Interest in plants and how they grow.  Most times listed on seed packages were correct, but there were some differences.  To ensure that what is listed is accurate to people who buy them and learn that different seeds grow at different rates.
This project has been cleared by SRC.


Comments

You spent a long time on this project and got very good results.  Sometimes it seems like the seeds will never sprout when I plant them.
This experiment is great, I am impressed by how you were able to implement experiments on plants. Nice research! - Venkata Manikonda
