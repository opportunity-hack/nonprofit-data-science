1. My project is about testing to see which cleaning method is best for  removing bacteria from your phone. The methods are: cleaned with disinfectant wipes; cleaned with UV phone cleaner; finally cleaned with disinfectant wipes plus UV light phone cleaner.
2. I chose this project because I feel many people want to know which phone cleaning method is the best because in the time of COVID-19 people want to be safe from sickness. I also wanted everyone to know  that phone have lots of germs on them, so it is important to clean your phone.
3. My overall result is that the UV phone cleaner plus disinfectant wipes is the best cleaning method. But if you can't access a UV phone cleaner, disinfectant wipes will work almost as well.
4. My project is important because people may not know which method is the best at cleaning, or they don't know that phone carry lots and lots of germs. Also, my project will let people know which cleaning method in the best at removing germs on your phone.
Keywords: Disinfectant wipes, UV phone cleaner, COVID-19, Bacteria.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
