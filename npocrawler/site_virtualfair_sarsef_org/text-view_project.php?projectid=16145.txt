Growing Big and Strong Crystals

Key words: crystal, temperature

This project aims to grow crystals in water that is kept in cold and normal temperatures.  I chose to do this project because I grew interested in exploring how chemical reactions happen and lead to some discoveries. At the end of my project, I found out that crystals grow bigger and stronger in cold water. The crystals in the normal water grew slower and thinner. My project showed that cold temperature and chemical reactions are related since this chemical reaction happened faster in cold water. Temperature differences can lead to different chemical reactions, which can happen slower or faster.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Interesting to see such a difference in crystals just from the temperature of the water. Excellent job!
After boiling, did you cool both containers to room temp before starting the crystal growth? Did you refridgerate the "cold water" container? Seeing your notes would have helped answer my questions.
Interesting project. I hope you take it to the next step as, in nature, it's hot solutions that result in crystal growth. It would be interesting to relate your project to nature.
