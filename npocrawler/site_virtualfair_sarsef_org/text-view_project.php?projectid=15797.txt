HS-BE024
The Effects of Different Genders and Races on Students SAT Scores
Behavioral and Social Science

Raegan N. Bennett
Grade:
HS

Teacher:
Elyse Wexler

This project shows a direct comparison between different races and genders among students vs. their SAT scores. I chose this project because I am interested in the field of psychology and thought this project would allow me to explore this topic. The results showed that overall males scored a higher mean score than females. A cause of this phenomenon is that males have higher expected scores and confidence when approaching an academic task while females have less confidence leading to lower scores. It was also found that in a social setting, races that receive more stereotypes and discrimination towards their personal race receive lower quality and quantity of sleep, resulting in lower academic performance. Noticing these observations in social and academic settings can lead to overall improvements in future academic performances.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
