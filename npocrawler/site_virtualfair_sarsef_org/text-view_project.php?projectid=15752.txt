I’m trying to teach people how to recycle cereal boxes by making labels, putting them on the box the labels will have a link to the website. The school cereal drive was the perfect opportunity to get my project out to people in the community. On every cereal box that was donated we put a label with a QR code for people to go to to be educated about recycling and to find cool projects that can be made by repurposing the cardboard.
The website is where we are going to get the data and post ideas for the boxes. It is also where people will post a picture of their boxes. The three main things are: value, nutritious, and reusable. The reason that I picked to do this is because last
year I did a project on not throwing food away then I donated it to a food bank. I wanted to do a second part, but covid came so I picked to do this because it is still reusing something and donating food.
