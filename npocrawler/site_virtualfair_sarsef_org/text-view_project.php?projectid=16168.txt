I am studying the time it takes a heart to return to its resting heart rate after 1 ½ ing the resting heart rate by exercising, depending on how high the resting heart rate is. I chose this project because I was wondering why I took less time to cool down after exercising than older and larger humans. My overall results were that humans with a higher resting heart rate and their recovery time only had about a 78% correlation. However, the more interesting data was that the relationship between humans BMIs and heart rate recovery time was a very significant 95%. This means that the lower a human's BMI, and the healthier they are, the faster their heart will recover and return to their resting heart rate after exertion. This project is important because it can not only aid scientists and doctors when helping patients with their heart problems and explaining certain human’s heart rates and resting heart rates, but this information can also help many different people recognize which type and level of exercising is best for them and their hard working heart.
Key words: resting-heart rate, heart, BPM (beats per minute), and BMI (body mass index).
This project has been cleared by SRC.
