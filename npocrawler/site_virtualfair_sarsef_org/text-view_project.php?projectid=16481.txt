Health and Wellness

Grade:
8

Teacher:
MariAnn Slater

What is your project about? 
In this experiment I will be testing the bacterial growth on a makeup sponge over periods of time, for example I will have five sponges that will be used everyday for three weeks, two weeks, one week, and one day.  

Why did you choose this project?
I chose this project because I love to do makeup in my free time and I wanted to see how much bacteria actually builds up on the tools that we use everyday. 

What was your result/overall conclusion? 
The results for my experiment showed that the sponges used for three weeks gathered the most bacteria. 

Why is your project important? 
My project is important because it will inform others about how much bacteria is building up on our makeup tools and how it can possibly harm us.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
