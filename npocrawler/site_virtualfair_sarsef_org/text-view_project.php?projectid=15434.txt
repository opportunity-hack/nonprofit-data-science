My project is about testing how strong building my own adobe blocks can be so that I am able to build things with them. I want to build a doghouse made out of adobe blocks but first I need to test how strong they can be and if they are safe. I found out that the dirt in my yard has the right properties of clay and sand to make strong blocks; as long as I added some concrete mixture. It is important to use strong materials when building
This project has been cleared by SRC.
