This project analyzes hypodermic needles and microneedle patches and determines which inflicts the least amount of pain while still resulting in a successful injection. The results of my project show that hypodermic needles and microneedle patches are equally painless to an extent. I chose this project to learn more about an alternative to hypodermic needles. Potentially, people across the nation would be more willing to receive helpful vaccinations or have their children receive helpful vaccinations if the injection is less painful.
