Can We Save the Tea?

What we did for this project was design a float-able crate so we could save the tea. We only used materials made before or in 1773 like candles, rubber, tin  and more . Then we created three crates that could float on water without getting water on the inside. What we were trying to do was solve a problem from the past which was getting the tea wet that occurred during the Boston tea party. As a result we made three crates with rubber balls on the sides and sealed them with wax from melted candles used as a caulk, then we wrapped the tea bags with tin and we put it in the water, after a  minute we realized that there was no water inside and no tea got wet. We ended up saving the tea and proved this experiment could have changed history.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
