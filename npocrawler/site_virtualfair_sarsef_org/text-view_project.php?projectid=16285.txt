With remote learning I am always losing my supplies. The problem I am solving is when school supplies roll off your desk and you want to eliminate the distraction of having to get up from your desk to find them. Stick On Headphones help keep supplies organized and accessible while on Zoom. Each supply has a velcro strap to hold it in place. Stop spending your time looking for supplies you lost.
