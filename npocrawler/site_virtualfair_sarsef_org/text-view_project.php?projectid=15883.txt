The purpose of this experiment is to find the hull design that is the most effective for speed.? I became interested in this experiment because I wanted to learn more on how objects travel on water and because I thought naval architecture sounded interesting.? The information gained through this experiment will improve the speed of boat travel.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
