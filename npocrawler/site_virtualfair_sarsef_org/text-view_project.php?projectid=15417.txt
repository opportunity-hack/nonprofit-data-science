The effects of listening to music while doing math fact tests.  In particular, what genres of music was most effective.  My findings determined it was dependent of the person.  Some teachers play music to help students, but sometimes it is a detriment.
This project has been cleared by SRC.


Comments

I've used classical music in my classroom for years. I never would have thought to try something like techno music. My students may be getting something new soon. ;)
