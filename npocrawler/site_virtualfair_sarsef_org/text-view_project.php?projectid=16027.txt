The Effects of Common Household Residents on Individuals' Divergent Thinking
Behavioral and Social Science

Isaac Johnson
Grade:
HS

Teacher:
Elyse Wexler

This project is about the effects of different numbers of people living together on their divergent thinking, a part of creativity.
I chose this project because during this quarantine we're all stuck with the same set of people all day every day, and I wanted to know how that's effecting us.
This project found that average divergent thinking increased with both age and the number of people living together.
This project is important because in understanding how different factors affect our creativity, we can shape our surroundings to better our thinking.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
