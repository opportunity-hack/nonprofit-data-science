How Does the Use of Organic vs. Chemical Fertilizer Affect the Growth of Lima Beans?
Plant Science

Jordyn Decker
Grade:
HS

Teacher:
Elyse Wexler

This project is about learning how the use of chemical vs. organic fertilizer effects the growth of lime beans. I chose this project because I am very interested in gardening and would like to know how to keeps plants, and the environment healthier. My overall conclusion was that chemical fertilizer worked made the plants grow more in this 2 week growth period. This project helped me learn how I can grow plants in a healthy way so that they get the best nutrients and so do I.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
