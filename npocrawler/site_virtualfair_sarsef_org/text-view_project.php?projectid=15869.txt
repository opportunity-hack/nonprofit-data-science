Communication is an essential part of our everyday life, although it differs from person to person, depending on their ability and need. I decided to create a bracelet that would serve as a communication tool for people with sensory and social challenges. I started the research and my first prototype last year, and this year, I worked on putting it together on a wristband. We matched LED lights to needs and feelings and used several materials to put it together. It worked well and I would like to continue improving my design next year.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Clever design! I'll be interested in your next design. It's wonderful that you're thinking of ways to help others communicate their needs and feelings.
I love that you are continuing to work on improving your original design!  This is also a very thoughtful idea to aid individuals with sensory and social challenges.
