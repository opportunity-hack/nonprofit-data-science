For this engineering project, I wanted to design a hat that is able to store small items. I was inspired to design a new hat because when you attend sporting events, you often do not have enough hands to carry your beverages, food and other items and many events only allow you to carry in transparent bags. My hat will include an internal pocket that will store items such as keys, cash, credit cards, or gum. It is like a third pocket on your head. The design will include a method to open and close the hat using a pneumatic air pump.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
