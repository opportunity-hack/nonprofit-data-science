My project was testing how different SPF sunscreen protected the skin of a potato. I wanted to do this project because there are many different SPFs and I wanted to see what worked the best. I learned that the higher SPF did protect the skin of the potato better then the lower or no SPF. This is important to know because we want to keep our skin safe and protected for the sun.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
