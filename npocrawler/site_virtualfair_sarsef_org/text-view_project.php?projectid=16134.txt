I am testing to see if dogs like homemade dog treats or store bought treats. I had two dogs do a taste test  to come to my conclusion.

I hope your dogs appreciated your hard work!
Innovative idea. It was nice that you could create an experiment around your question.  Great that your dog got to participate!
