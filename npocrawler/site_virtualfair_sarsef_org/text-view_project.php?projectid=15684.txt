My project is about creating and comparing two types of optical theremins, traditional and using Arduino, to see if they could detect something cat-sized. I chose the project because I thought that optical theremins could be utilized in ways other than music. In the end, the theremin made using Arduino was more accurate. It was important because it showed that newer ways of making optical theremins are in fact more accurate, and they can be used for more than music.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
