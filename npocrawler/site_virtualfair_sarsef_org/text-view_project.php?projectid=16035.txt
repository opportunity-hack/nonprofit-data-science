Our project is about living on the moon. Using the Future City theme, we choose this project to create solutions for successful lunar habitation both wanted and needed for the future. Our overall results of this project shows that through innovative technology and engineering, the use of the Moon's natural resources, can play a big role in creating a strong reliable lunar city. By using resources like solar power, water ice, and especially regolith (lunar soil), expenses are cut down and those resources are used in innovative way for the city. Our project is important because we are designing and constructing a city that is sustainable, clean, and resilient, with thriving life on the moon. Keywords:  artificial intelligence, waste management, water, innovative, natural resources, lunar, resilient, regolith, solar power, habitat.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
