A Cryptocraft: From Caesar to Now

This project is about analyzing the difference between the Caesar shift cipher handwritten and through code, and how one is more efficient than the other. I chose this project because I'm interested in cybersecurity and I believe that when I begin learning about this, I should start from the basics and learn from the beginning. My overall result is that this would have been an efficient cipher in the past, but not in this present day. My project is important because in the modern digital age, cybersecurity and understanding it is essential.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
