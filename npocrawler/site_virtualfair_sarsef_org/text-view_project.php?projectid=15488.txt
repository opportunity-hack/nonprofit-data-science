6-EE001
Solar Power and the Angle of the Sun
Energy and Environmental Engineering

Grade:

Teacher:
Mrs. Wellman

The project will demonstrate how a solar panel’s power changes as the angle of light from the sun that hits it changes. I will accomplish this by measuring the change in amperage of the solar panel as the time of day changes.
This project has been cleared by SRC.


Comments

You ask an important question in this project! Your observation about shade from trees is a good one. Next time it would be good to run this experiment multiple times in different locations.
What a great project!
