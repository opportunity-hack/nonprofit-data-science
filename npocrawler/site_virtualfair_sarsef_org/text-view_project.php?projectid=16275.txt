How do different scenarios affect the level of oxygen in my blood?

I chose this project because me and my family have asthma, and I thought it would be interesting.

Apparently, the situations in which you will get the most oxygen in your blood are using a fan and just breathing regularly. Also, breathing steam and double masking negatively affects the intake of oxygen.

This is important because it can help people if they have respiration issues.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
