Meredith Burgess Class
Grade:
4

Teacher:
Meredith Burgess

As a class we spend a lot of time on our devices and in particular computers. We
wanted to see which computer/device took the longest time to get to 50%.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Great work!  Very practical.  Does using wifi drain the battery faster than not using wifi?  If yes, can you think of reasons about why that would be?
I love all of the observations! I wonder what you might try to compare the devices so  more variables stayed the same - either no use or little use? Which would last longest?
