Teacher:
Mr. Greg Gaines

My project is about coral growth, specifically zoanthids. I chose this project because I have always liked marine biology. My results show that there is noway to have 100% success at growing zoanthids/other coral if you want to. My project is important because it helps other people.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
