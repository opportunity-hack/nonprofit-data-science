Which is more important for cloud duration and thickness: temperature or water? I chose this project because I like clouds. Temperature is more important for cloud duration and thickness. Making the cloud top as cold as you can and the cloud bottom as warm as possible makes the thickest and longest lasting cloud. By understanding clouds, people can better understand the water cycle and the weather.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

I was really impressed with your project. You took items that are readily available at home and created clouds. Your research was also really well done. Good job!
