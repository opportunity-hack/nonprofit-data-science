Can Different Music Genres Affect a Person’s Heart Rate?

My project is about if music can affect a person's heart rate. I chose this project because I have heard that music can affect people's heart rates and I wanted to see if it was true. The results of my project is that faster paced music increases a person’s heart rate and slower paced music decreases a person’s heart rate. My project is important because if further experiments are conducted it could change how humans see music.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
