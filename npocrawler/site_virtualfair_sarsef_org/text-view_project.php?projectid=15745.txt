Elyse Wexler

My project is about children with developmental disorders and their parents/guardians and if they observe satisfaction from the schools and programs, they are enrolled in. I chose this project because I have a special interest in children, I hope to become a pediatrician in the future. Overall, we concluded that most children and parents/guardians do observe satisfaction from the schools and programs they are enrolled in. My project is important because children with developmental disorders rely on the resources the schools and programs offer them. As well, it is important that these children are receiving proper care and education that fits to their needs.

Wow!
It is so important to know if/how special needs programs are working for children with special needs.  Thank you for studying this!  Mrs. Wexler
