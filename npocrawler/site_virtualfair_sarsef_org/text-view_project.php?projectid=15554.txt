Clot Buster... don't block me now. How does using aspirin affect blood flow rate? This science fair project was on aspirin and how it affects blood clots. The goal of this project was to examine how aspirin affects blood flow rate. Many people take aspirin to help prevent heart attacks and strokes. It works by unsticking clumps of platelets in a blood vessel. The procedure incorporated three sets of straws used to model three different types of blood vessels healthy, diseased, and blocked. One straw was a model of a healthy blood vessel with no blockage, another straw was a model of a blocked blood vessel using a 5 mm plug of cotton wool pushed near the end, and the last model was a diseased blood vessel using a 5 mm plug of margarine pushed near the end. Straws were labeled, observed, and noted to find which were blocked or open. 20 ml of warm water was measured in a syringe and pushed into the straw. The time was observed and recorded. Steps were repeated with the second and third straws noting any observations. The results proved that the diseased blood vessel had the slowest time (average .12 seconds) followed by the blocked blood vessel (average .05 seconds). The healthy blood vessel had the fastest time (average .03 seconds). I hope to take my research into how COVID-19 affects the cardiovascular system.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
