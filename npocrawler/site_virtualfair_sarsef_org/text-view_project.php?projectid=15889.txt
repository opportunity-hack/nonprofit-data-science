BMX Racing: Do Gears Matter?
Physics, Astronomy, and Mathematics

Grade:

Teacher:
Mrs. Mitchell

I wanted to see if different gears would help a BMX race go faster. I choose the project because I like to race BMX bikes. I can make faster as long as you can pedal just as fast. The bigger the gear can be harder to pedal which slows you down.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
