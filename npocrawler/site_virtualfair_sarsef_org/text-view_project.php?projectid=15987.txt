In this project we wanted to design a machine that would take send our trash along a conveyor belt and drop it into our trash can. We have a problem with trash and papers on the floor at the end of the day. It would be so much easier if there was a machine that could throw away our trash for us. The second prototype with a conveyor belt was our most successful design. We would like to test on a bigger scale soon. This project was important because we were solving a common problem in many classrooms.
