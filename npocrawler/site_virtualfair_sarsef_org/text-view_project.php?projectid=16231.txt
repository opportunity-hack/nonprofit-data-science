Wondering if Plants Like Milk

My Project is to find out through experiments how plants grow if they are watered with water, milk or coffee. I was wondering if milk would be better food for plants than water as it is for babies. Also, I supposed coffee will be worse food for plants. My conclusion is plants do not grow better with milk. Milk contains fat and calcium that make it difficult for plants to grow. Water is better and then coffee. It is important to understand how nutrients act on different living beings. It was not so obvious to discover that plants were not going to grow well with only milk
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Great work! You learned a lot from this project.
This is an exciting experiment. I like how you tested your hypothesis and measured your results with different plants. You were very thorough.
Very interesting! Great job!
What an interesting experiment.  We would think that all things grow with the same nutrients.  Your experiment proves that is not the case.  Well done!
Plants don't! Good experiment on trying to implement ideas! Good Project!
