My project is about designing a new sky elevator system to improve the launch and especially landing of rockets by improving fuel efficiency, safety, and accuracy. I chose this project because rocket science is interesting to me, I watch Space-X and Starship news, I like playing and designing rockets in Kerbal Space Program in my spare time. My conclusion is that Elevapter (the sky elevator) can lift middle-sized rockets (up to 10 tons) to 10km and catch them there to save between $5k-$8k during landing and $170k during launch. This project is very important because if we want to make space travel common like air travel and start living on other planets, we need to make it cheap and safe to fly on a rocket.
