HS-BE036
The Effects of Geographic Mobility on Family Size
Behavioral and Social Science

Sophia Camargo
Grade:
HS

Teacher:
Elyse Wexler

This project is about the effects of geographic mobility on family size and poverty levels. I chose this project due to growing concern about gentrification. The results show that the rate of geographic mobility does not have an effect on average family size. This project can pave the way for future research regarding gentrification and urbanization.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
