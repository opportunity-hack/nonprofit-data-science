My project is about eggshell geodes form. 
I chose this project because it looks interesting. 
My result was sea salt grew the most crystals. 
My project is important because I am learning about chemical reactions and how geodes grow.
This project has been cleared by SRC.


Comments

I've grown crystals in egg shells before but never like this. Interesting project.
Great job Jacob, we are so proud of you! Love, Mom, Dad, and Charles
That was really interesting:) I did not know you could grow crystals in eggshells. I should try that.
