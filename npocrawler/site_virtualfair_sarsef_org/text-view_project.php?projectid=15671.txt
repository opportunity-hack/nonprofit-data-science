In Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) Patient Tissue, UG Rich RNA Is Not Preferentially Soluble as Predicted

My project is about Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), a devastating adult-onset neurodegenerative disease.  My project focuses on answering the question if UG Rich RNAs are preferentially soluble in ALS patient tissues.  I chose this project because it was a continuation from my project last year, in which there was data to support that UG Rich RNAs are preferentially soluble in a fruit fly model of ALS.  My overall conclusion was that soluble patient genes are not significantly enriched for UG sequences.  This project is important because understanding how ALS functions on the cellular level will be crucial to the development of effective treatments in the future.
