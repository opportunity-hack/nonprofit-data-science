HS-PS010
Mineral Availability From Soil to Citrus Fruits Compared to Limonene Content
Plant Science

Ryan Martinez, Tyler Martinez
Grade:
HS

Teacher:
Kimberly Adkins

Our project is about how a certain chemical found in citrus fruits prevents minerals like iron and calcium from maintaining retention. We choose this project because we have a diverse bunch of citrus trees and we figured we would have the capacity to run this project. We found that the more Limonene (a chemical) present in citrus fruits, the less iron and calcium the citrus fruit retained regardless of how much iron and calcium was in the soil that the plant was in. This project is important because it shows that Limonene can prevent the retention or absorption of certain minerals, and there is real world applications to this discovery: pesticides, human health, etc.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
