Regular physical activity is important for our overall health and well-being as it helps our cardiovascular system work more efficiently. Research tells us that physical activity provides us more energy to tackle our daily chores and routines, but does it help students focus more during instruction and learning? 

We are currently experiencing a global pandemic that has had and continues to have drastic effects on our daily routines, specifically our school routines. Stay-at-home orders have caused many of us to live a more sedentary life while we are working and learning from home. For instance, during a regular in-school day, kids would have a morning recess, a snack recess, a lunch recess, and many transitions throughout the day that would require them to move their bodies. During remote learning, where students are learning from home, kids are missing out on their recess times and transition times where they would be getting in lots of movement and activity. How has this fundamental change in our children’s educational routines affected their focus and attention during instruction? If movement exercises were added to daily “zoom” lessons, will students focus increase? Would students feel happier and more eager to learn?
This project has been cleared by SRC.
