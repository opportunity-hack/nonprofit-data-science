The purpose of this experiment is to see if alternate liquids can be used for turf grass irrigation. This project was chosen because water is limited in Arizona due to the severe drought. The outcome of this experiment was some common household liquids could be used for turf grass irrigation, but this research shows they may not perform as well as water. This project is important because it could help to conserve water in areas of drought.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
