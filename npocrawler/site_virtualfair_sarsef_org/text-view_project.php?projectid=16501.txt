Is Black Really Black?
Chemical Science

Grade:

1.In this experiment, I will be using the method of chromatography using different black markers to determine if black ink is actually black.
2. I chose this project because, as an artist these kinds of things interest me since there are some of these colors that don't have to be made with other colors. I want to see if the color black is actually black or just made with other colors
3. My results for this experiment showed limited to no separation for the Expo dry erase marker, Tru Red dry erase, and Posca marker. This shows that a different technique of separation will be needed to show those colors. The Sharpie separated into  Lime  Green, Light Blue, Dark Indigo, and Violet.  The Tru Red permanent separated into Honey yellow, Aqua green, Violet.  The data shows that the color black is made up of many different colors. 

4. My project is important because it is interesting information to other artist.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
