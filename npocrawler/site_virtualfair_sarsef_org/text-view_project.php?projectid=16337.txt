I researched about how dancing effects your emotions. I chose this project because I love to dance. I took surveys before and after movement. My results showed that people were happier after. My project is important because it is important to find healthy ways to improve your mood.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

I like that you tested so many participants!
This is one of my favorite project!  Good job!  I know dancing always makes me happy and in a better mood!  I like that you woul try different genres of music to see how it might change the outcome.
