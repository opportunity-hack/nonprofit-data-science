1. This project is about determining how a variety of types of surface conditions affect the ability of a bike to stop completely. I chose this project to help me and other a way to be prepared prior to a ride they do. I found out that gravel had the overall greatest effect on the braking capabilities.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
