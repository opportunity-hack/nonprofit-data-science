HS-HB023
Effects of Depression on GPA
Health and Biomedical Science

Tayen Funke
Grade:
HS

Teacher:
Elyse Wexler

My project is about the different stages of depression (before, before treatment, after treatment) and how a student's GPA fluctuates between those stages. I chose to do this project because I believe that mental health is washed over in our school system and it needs to be shown how important of an issue it is. My conclusion was that GPA is lowered by depression, and even after treatment still doesn't recover to what it was previously. My project is important because mental health is a growing issue in today's world and students are struggling because of it.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
