Our project tested how changing the pH and salinity of a solution affects the amount of electricity that can be run through it. We chose this project because we didn't know very much about pH and wanted to learn more about it. We also find electricity very interesting and thought that it would be fun to do an experiment involving both. We found that changing the pH and the salinity of a solution both had an effect on the amount of electricity that could be run through it. Changing the pH had a much larger effect than changing the salinity. Our project is important because it could be useful in designing more efficient ways to store and transport electricity.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
