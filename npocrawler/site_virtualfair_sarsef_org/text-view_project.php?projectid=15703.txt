I am always looking for ways to get a higher score on my test at school or ways to improve my memory

So I sat and wondered if there’s a movement that can help me increase my memory before a test. I have recently started yoga and my favorite pose is the “Adho Mukha Vrksasana”. For those of you who do not do yoga, that move is the “Downward Face Tree Pose’’. This pose is also known as a simple handstand. I tested several people to see if doing a handstand would improve their memory.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Wow! This is very impressive! So will you do handstands?vmvm
Great work. Lots of details. We’re never too old to learn something new. Very original, I wonder what would happen if the handstand were for a longer time? Impressive!
You learn something new everyday. I will need to start practicing my handstands to prevent grey hair
Interesting! This is really well done! Great Project!
Interesting that the adults scored higher doing a handstand! Blood flow to the brain was impacted by age and health of the heart and arteries. Evidenced by the younger kids score! Great project!
