Mental Health-During COVID-19: How Are Students Really Doing?
Health and Wellness

Danielle Carrasco, Prakriti Sangraula
Grade:
8

Teacher:
Sang Lee

Me and my partner’s project was to overall check the mentality of our school students during these tough times. I chose this mainly because my friends always would struggle with school and I wanted them to realize they aren’t alone. My overall results were that students found their mental health went down. My project is important because it shows that no one is alone during these tough times and others have same experience. 
Keywords: COVID, mentality, student, and wellness
This project has been cleared by SRC.
