This project investigated if Prosopis glandulosa leaves extract could lower the antibiotic resistance of E. coli, S. lutea and S. epidermidis when mixed with different types of antibiotics. Every year about 35000 people in United states die because of antibiotic resistance infection. That is one of the reasons why I chose this topic.
Based on the results of the experiment, the extract from P. glandulosa leaves extract was successful on lowering the antibiotic resistance of the tested bacteria when compared to the control treatments.
I believe this research is important as finding alternative cure to some diseases will help us to survive and have a better life.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
