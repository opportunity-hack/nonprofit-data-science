7-BE001
Hear It or See It: Determining the Best Way to Give a Math Test
Behavioral and Social Science

Aerie  Barnett
Grade:
7

Teacher:
Ms. Wermuth

For my project, I will be testing to see if people do better on tests if they hear it orally or if it is written on paper. First, I will give everybody three math tests, and I will tell them the questions, then, they will have three math tests, but they will have to read it and answer the questions on their own.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
