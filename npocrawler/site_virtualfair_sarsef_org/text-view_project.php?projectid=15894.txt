How to recreate a window in a house built in the early 1900s.  We have a bunkhouse that was built in the early 1900s.  A new type of window will not fit into the house.  After several tries, we were able to create a mechanism that would work to open and shut the window. This is important for a couple of reasons, first to keep the integrity of the house and second to be able to make a window to fit.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
