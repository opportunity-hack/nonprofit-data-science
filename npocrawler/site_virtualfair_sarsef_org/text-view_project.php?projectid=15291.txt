This project concerns the addition of off-the-shelf probiotics into lightly aged cheese. To both increase the number of beneficial microbes in the diet and potentially enhance the eating experience of cheese, I tested the use of Lactobacillus Acidophilus as a supplemental and standalone starter culture for cheese. The experiment produced cheese of varying qualities, showing that Acidophilus can enhance the taste and texture of cheese, but is not viable as a stand-alone starter. This information could potentially be applied industrially and could promote both the cheese industry and a healthy microbiome.
