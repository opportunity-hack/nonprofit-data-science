The Box Cat Feeder

This project came about because my cat Oscar needed to gain some weight, but my other cat Anne would always steal his food. Anne needed to also go on a diet. I build a box feeder so Anne could not take Oscars food. It worked well and my family still uses it. This project was  important so my cats can be healthy.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

very innovative - and successful
I really like how you used the knowledge of strengths and weaknesses of each cat in your design. That's good problem solving!
WOW this is amazing! I'm definitely going to do/use this for my cat!!
