My project is called “The Water Bottle Recycler.”  It is an invention  for people who like to reuse or recycle plastic water bottles.   “The Water Bottle Recycler” is a funnel tied to the tip of a balloon and the balloon is attached to the water bottle.  The funnel is then placed underneath the refrigerator water spout and now the water bottle is able to be refilled with filtered water without making a HUGE mess.  My invention is a way to help the environment and create less waste throughout the world.
