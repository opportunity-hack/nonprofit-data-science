My idea is testing a theory where I take different Nerf bullets shoot it out of the same gun and see which one is better though a range test. What inspired me and my brother have these big Nerf war and for some reason every bullet is better and I want to put it to the test. The questions that I asked is how far can it go? How accurate is the bullet? My purpose to my project is so I can be better at Nerf war and beat my brother more.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

I remember nerf fights when I was younger. This project was a creative idea and you really took it to the next level with your analysis. Great job!
