Our project is about the effects of screen time on our body and mental health. We chose this project because we all spend a lot of time in front of screens, especially since we are learning during a global pandemic. Overall, we learned that screen time has a negative impact on our physical and mental health. This project is important to us because we care about the health of others and think their opinions matter.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
