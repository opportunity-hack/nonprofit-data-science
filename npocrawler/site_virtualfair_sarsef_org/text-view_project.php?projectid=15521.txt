The project was to see if batteries lasted longer in freezing temperature, or room temperature.  I chose this project because I thought it was an interesting to see how long the batteries would last.  It's important to know especially for your car battery, to either keep in a garage in freezing temperatures, or outside.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Good Job - I used to think putting batteries in the freezer would preserve them longer.  Now I know better.  Thanks.
