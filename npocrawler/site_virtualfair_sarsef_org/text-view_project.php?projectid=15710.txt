The project is about the different microwave oven wattages change the number of popcorn kernels left.  My friend and I were eating popcorn and wondered why some kernels didn't pop.  The results of the science experiment was that if the microwave oven wattage is to low it will pop the kernels to slow and if the microwave oven wattage is to high it will pop the kernels to fast.  This project is important because if someone wanted to make their own microwave popcorn they need to know what the best microwave wattage is to use.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

What a fun project! You got to do science and I bet you ate a lot of popcorn while you were at it. Good job.
