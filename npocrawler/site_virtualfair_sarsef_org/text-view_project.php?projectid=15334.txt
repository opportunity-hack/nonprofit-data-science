This experiment was chosen because I like smoking meat with my dad and noticed that some meat cuts take longer to cook than others, therefore you need the coals to maintain heat and not have to replace them. Could something be done to have coals maintain heat longer, such as the arrangement of charcoal briquettes (dumped or
neatly arranged)?  The results showed that if briquettes are arranged neatly they maintain heat longer because they are packed together,
allowing less air in, therefore burning slower. This is important in the conservation of resources, like coal.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
