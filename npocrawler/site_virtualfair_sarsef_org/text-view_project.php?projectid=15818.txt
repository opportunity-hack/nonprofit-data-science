Ashlyn Lehwald Class
Grade:
3

Teacher:
Ashlyn Lehwald

Our class decided to test out who has a quicker reaction time, boys or girls, based on 4 different tests completed online.  We researched and discussed why reaction time is important.  We determined that reaction time is important for people’s everyday lives.  We involved a little competition to make the project interesting.  We found boys have a quicker reaction time than girls in 3 of the 4 tests. Your reaction time can help when you are in danger or someone else is in danger.  Your reaction time is used when driving, playing sports, or doing any other daily tasks where you need to respond quickly.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
