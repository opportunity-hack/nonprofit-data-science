HS-BE037
Red: Human Behaviors and Emotions
Behavioral and Social Science

Anthony Bravo
Grade:
HS

Teacher:
Elyse Wexler

This project is about the color psychology of the color red *human behaviors and emotions of red). I chose this project because in the past, I've always associated the color red as negative and scary and bold, but others have seen the color red as a very pleasant and blissful color, so it really intrigued me to see how others interpret it. My overall conclusion was that along various age groups, the majority of interpretations have remained similar. My project could potentially help psychologists or scientists with future studies, and can help others understand color psychology.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
