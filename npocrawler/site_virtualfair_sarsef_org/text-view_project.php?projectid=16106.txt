Air Resistance of Dice
Physics, Astronomy, and Mathematics

Grade:
8

Teacher:
Sang Lee

My project was about how much shape and mass affect air resistance of an object. I chose this project because I like dice and physics. My conclusion was that shape and size do matter when it comes to air resistance. This project is important to better understand air resistance on different shapes as they fall.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
