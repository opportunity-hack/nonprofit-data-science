HS-EN010
Optimizing the Chemical Production of Hydrogen Gas
Energy and Environmental Engineering

Creating hydrogen gas as a clean fuel alternative to fossil fuel.
I created hydrogen gas with a chemical reaction with two experiments and compared which created more hydrogen gas.

Zn + HCl or Al + H20.

Results showed Al + H20 (with sodium hydroxide as a catalyst)
created more hydrogen gas.

This is important to prove hydrogen can be produced so it can be incorporated as an alternative fuel source.
