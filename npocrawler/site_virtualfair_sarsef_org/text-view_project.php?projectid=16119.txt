My project is about which method of electronic communication allows for the most meaningful connection between participants and why.

 I chose to do this project because in a time where school is online, many people are working remotely, and the COVID-19 pandemic has forced people to remain socially distant and isolate, the need to connect with others not in person is important for physical and emotional health. 

I found that out of texting, phone calling, and video conferencing/calls, the majority of people who took my survey, found video calls to be the most meaningful method of communication because first it allowed for assessment of the
other persons tone and second it allowed respondents to see the other person.

 My project is important because during this unprecedented year of increased social isolation, it is especially important to connect with our friends and family and find the most meaningful way to make
those connections.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
