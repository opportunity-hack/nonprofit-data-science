My project is about Solar panels being applied onto a remote controlled vehicle to determine if solar powered cars could be viable. I chose to do this project because I believe that solar powered electric cars are the future and will be utilized within 10 years and I wanted to see for myself if it was viable. My overall results turned out to support my initial claim, that a higher quality solar panel will result in longer life spans of the vehicle. This project is important because it will be the future of the automotive industry within the next 10 years, to implement solar powered electric vehicles.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Way to think outside the box! Great job in reconizing some variables that may have caused error and considering the reasoning why those variables effected your results; room for further investigation.
