1.My project is about a radio control car that I use to feed my birds. 2.I
chose this project because I don't want to go up the hill and risk
getting stabbed by a thorny stick. 3.My conclusion was that the car
worked great! It actually worked better than planned. 4. This also
helps the birds. Using bird feeders is dangerous because if a sick bird
uses it the next bird gets sick too.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

You did such a great job on this project! I really love it. It's nice to see how all of your hard work really pays off.
Nice project! Looks like a fun way to keep the birds safe and fed.
Excellent  project from conception to execution.  The evaluation was well written. I think the birds appreciate your thoughtfulness!
