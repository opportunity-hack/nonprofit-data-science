This project tests whether or not we are better able to guess a food's flavor when we can see the color.  We chose this project, because we are interested in neurogastronomy and were curious about the role that color plays in eating. After feeding people with and without blindfolds, we discovered that determining flavor does have a lot to do with seeing color.  More people correctly guessed flavors when they could see the corresponding colors. 

neurogastronomy, taste, taste buds, sight, psychology
This project has been cleared by SRC.
