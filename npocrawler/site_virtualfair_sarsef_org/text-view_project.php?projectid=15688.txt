The Effects One's Race Has on How Long Someone Will Sentence Them for a Certain Crime

In our justice system, it has been a long struggle to identify and eliminate implicit racial bias from the juries of convicted criminals. There is still no way of identifying where and why implicit racial bias is affecting the results of jury convictions in court, because there is almost no way of identifying anything that is implicit. People continuously argue that every court case is different so there is no way of comparing the results of two cases to find if implicit racial bias affected the results. Because of this many people have stopped realizing how prejudicial our justice system can be. In this experiment I sent out a survey to average american citizens to have them make a decision oncc how long a prison term for a specific case should be, as if they were a jury on the case. Half of the participants got a description of a white criminal, the other half received a description of a black criminal. The results of the two surveys were too similar to be able to detect any implicit racial bias. The more research gone into identifying implicit racial bias and eliminating it not only from our courtrooms and justice systems but also from our world, the more fair and equal our lives would be.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
