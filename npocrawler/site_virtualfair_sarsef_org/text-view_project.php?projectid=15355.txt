HS-EA013
The Effects of Soil Rockiness on Percent of Soil Erosion
Earth and Environmental Science

Jordan Pendleton Casto, Lily Pendleton Casto
Grade:
HS

Teacher:
Elyse Wexler

1. How the percent of rocks in soil can effect the amount of soil ruoff
2. We wanted to know if rockiness has an effect on erosion and to better understand what land we need to protect (what land is most susceptable to soil erosion)
3. The results were that the soil with the most percent of rocks had the highest percent of soil erosion. The 0% Rocks in desert soil had 0.51% soil erosion. The 50% Rocks in desert soil had 0.92% soil erosion. The 95% Rocks in desert soil had 3.95% soil erosion. 
4. This experiment is important to help people become more aware about negative effects of soil erosion-- nutrient loss, lessened crop yields, algal bloom, topsoil loss, and sedimentation. With a better knowledge surrounding the topic of soil erosion, we can better fight these negative effects on the environment.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
