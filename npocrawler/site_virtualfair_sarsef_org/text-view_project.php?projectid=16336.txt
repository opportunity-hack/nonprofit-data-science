Does This Water Conduct Electricity?

Have you ever wondered why you can't go swimming during a thunderstorm? It's probably because someone said you would get struck by lightning from being in the water. This makes you think that it is the water that is conduction the electricity. Well, it's not actually the water, it's the impurities in the water that conduct electricity. So, if the water was completely purified, you could still get struck by lightening while swimming. I will be testing tap water versus distilled water to test the conductivity of each.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
