The Food Preferences of Leo the Western Painted Turtle
Animal and Plant Science

Grade:
6

Teacher:
Kristen Aguanno

My project is about feeding my turtle different safe foods and seeing which one she likes the most.  I chose it because I wanted to see which fruit she wants to eat and which fruit she prefers.  My project is important because I wanted to give my turtle the foods that she needs for her nutrition.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Cool project! Now you know what your turtle likes best and can make him happy. :) (and definitely no grapes for him as a treat, doesn't seem to like those at all)
