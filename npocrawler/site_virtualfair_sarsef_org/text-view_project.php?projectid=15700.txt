What is your project about?
My project is about designing a shoe that combines other types of shoes into one shoe.



Why did you choose this project?
I chose this because I have played many sports and have always had to pay for a new one each time the new season arrived.


What was your result/overall conclusion?
My result was that the shoe that had the velcro on the sides and back did not let the sole of the shoe fall off the cleats.


Why is your project important?
My project is important because kids who are less fortunate will be able to play multiple sports and not struggle to afford more expensive shoes.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
