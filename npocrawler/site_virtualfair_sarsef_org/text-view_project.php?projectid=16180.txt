Maddy’s Mask Dryer 5000 Engineering Fair Project
Earth and Environmental Sciences

Madelyn Haselhorst
Grade:

Teacher:
Monica Flores

My project is about inventing a mask dryer that keeps the shape of your mask, prevents wrinkling, and saves money. I chose it to help people out all over the world. I found that it does in fact save time, money, and prevents wrinkling and shrinking. It's important to stay healthy and wear a clean mask.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
