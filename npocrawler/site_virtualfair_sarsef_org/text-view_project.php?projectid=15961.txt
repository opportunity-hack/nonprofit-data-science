In this experiment , I will be testing different types of bags to figure out how it effects the weight it holds. The purpose of this experiment is to find out which bag is strongest. I became interested in the experiment because when I read it , it seemed interesting. The information gained through this experiment will help people figure out which bag to buy.  
This project has been cleared by SRC.


Comments

Good idea for a project. Both paper and plastic bags are problematic for the environment. This was helpful in comparing the two options.
