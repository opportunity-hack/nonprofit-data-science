This project investigated what the ideal amount of seconds is to wait after using a wipe on a surface in order to eliminate most hazardous bacteria. This project was chosen to find out how to disinfect my house properly. The overall result was that waiting 15 seconds after wiping a surface was most effective at preventing bacterial growth. This project is important because it helps stop the spread of infectious diseases through direct contact.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
