I will be making something to stop litter from getting out in the ocean so much.  My project is about collecting litter from the ocean.  It will be a shovel with holes that is guided by a sail and has two plastic arms to help collect litter.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Nice engineering project! You added a lot of context and details! Great Work!
I think helping our fellow marine creatures is always going to be relevant in science and the health for our planet. Awesome work with this thorough project!
