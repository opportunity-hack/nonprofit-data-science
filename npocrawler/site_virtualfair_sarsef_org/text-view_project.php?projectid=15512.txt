The purpose of this project is to show the easiest way to remove copper from blonde hair after swimming. I chose this project because many people struggle with the green residue in blonde hair after swimming, and I wanted to find the easiest way to remove it.  In the end, the best solution to removing the green residue from blonde hair was the lemon juice. This project is important for people who don't know how to remove the green form their hair after swimming.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
