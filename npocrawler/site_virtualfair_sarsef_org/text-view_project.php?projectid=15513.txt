When people get thirsty they might wonder what source of water they should drink and may also want to know which water source is the safest to use? The purpose of this experiment was to find out which source of water was the safest to drink. Four sources of water were tested. The sources were well water, city water, bottled water, and filtered water. A water test strip kit was used to test for iron, alkalinity, pH, hardness, chlorine, copper, nitrate and nitrite levels. A TDS and EC meter was used to test the total dissolved solids. The EPA recommends iron levels of 0.3 PPM and under. Well water and city water tested at zero iron. Well water was the most basic and city water was the next basic water source. Water hardness is recommended to be under 50 PPM. City water tested 150 PPM over the recommended. Well water was 50 PPM over the recommended. Bottled and filtered water tested under 50 PPM. All the water sources had no chlorine and all the water samples tested at 1.3 PPM for copper. No nitrates or nitrites were found in any of the water samples. The result was that well water was the safest because the water hardness was not as hard as city water but met all the other parameters. I was incorrect in thinking that city water would be the safest because it is monitored by The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
