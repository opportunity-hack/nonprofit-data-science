My science fair project is an engineering project creating a robot folded from paper using techniques created in the art of origami. I chose this project because I have an interest in STEM fields such as science and technology, and I have an interest in origami. My project resulted in an autonomous robot made from 3D printed parts and folded paper. My project could be important to many different fields because the robot can be easily modified for a multitude of different uses.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
