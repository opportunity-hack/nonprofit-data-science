What is an ants favorite food?
Animal and Plant Sciences

Abby Henson
Grade:
2

Teacher:
Pawloski

I tested several foods against each other to determine what was an ant’s favorite. It is about what an ant’s favorite food is.Because I really liked ants and I wanted to do a science project that involved animals.The result is an ants favorite food is a blackberry, but blackberries don’t beat the ant food gel that people have created for ants to eat.If you wanted to take care of, or repel, ants it is good to know what the ants would want to eat.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
