What is my project about?
My project is seeing the different pH levels on individual water bottle brands.
Why did you choose this project?
I chose this project because I find water interesting since about 71% of Earth is
covered in water. Also water is super important for life.
What was your Results/Overall conclusion?
Each cup had the same amount of water, 1 cup of 18 ounces. Aquafina and
Dasani had water particles in them, they both had bubbles in them. Arrowheads
pH was 8.4 it’s higher than all the other brands which indicates it is Alkaline
water. Smart water had a pH of 6.8 that is the closest to the pH of 7. Aquafina,
Dasani, and LifeWTR all had the pH of 6.2 which makes it the lowest pH in all
and it indicates its Acidic water. In conclusion, the best water for you to drink is
Smart water.

Why is your project important?
My project is important because it's important to life on Earth.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
