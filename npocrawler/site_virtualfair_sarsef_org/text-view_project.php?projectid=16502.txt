Our project is about helping birds! We know it's hard for birds to find food in the winter and that they are important to our environment. My students and I designed and built bird feeders to attract birds to our backyards! We found out that this is hard. We learned a lot and feel this was important work. We also know our work is not done, just because this project is!
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Excellent class project.  Your hard work gave me many ideas for my own back yard.  Keep up your observations!
