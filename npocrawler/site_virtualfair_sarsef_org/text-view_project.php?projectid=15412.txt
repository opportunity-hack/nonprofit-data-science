This project is about diabetic retinopathy, which is a vision-threatening diabetic complication, and was chosen because of the large impact this condition has, affecting over 1/3 of the 422 million people living with diabetes and being the leading cause of blindness among working-age adults. Retinopathy is found to begin with neuronal damage but is unable to be detected until it has developed into a dangerous state where the blood vessels are affected. This project aimed to determine the effects of early diabetes on the mRNA of inhibitory neurotransmitters receptors by comparing Glra1 and Gabrr1 mRNA in control and diabetic retinas  It was found that there were changes in the expression and distribution of mRNA. This knowledge can be used to improve retinopathy treatments by suggesting specific treatments, possibly saving the vision of millions of people.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
