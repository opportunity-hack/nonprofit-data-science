This project studied the effects of climate and environmental changes on mesquite tree ring width. This is important for the use of mesquite in dendrochronology, archaeology, and climate research in places like the Sonoran Desert where mesquite is the main tree source. The results showed that mesquite tree rings can provide some historical information about climate and environment, but more research needs to be done. This research can provide a new tool to learn about changes to the climate and biosphere.
This project has been cleared by SRC.


Comments

The way you presented your process, data and interpretation is very clean. I like the way you looked at implications for the future science.
Very impressive research, particularly over a longer period of time than a single school year, or a week within a school year. Great work and great presentation of your work.
Your field study, research and implementation were very impressive.  There is a recently published book entitled "Tree Story" that may be of interest to you and your work.  Fantastic project!
