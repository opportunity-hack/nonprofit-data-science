Are Store Cleaning Policies Really Effective?
Health and Wellness

Grade:

Teacher:
Tracy Smith

My project is about whether store cleaning policies work or not. I chose this project because I thought it would be useful information to have. I concluded that cleaning policies are somewhat effective. My project is important because it is useful to know which stores have working cleaning policies.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
