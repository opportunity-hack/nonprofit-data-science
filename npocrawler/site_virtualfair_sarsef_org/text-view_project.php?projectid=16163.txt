I have a family of all girls! My mom, me, my two sisters, a female dog, and 4 hens. You can imagine our house is full of hair. E3 Hair Exterminator is the answer to this problem. Something similar exists, but this attaches to your drains. For example, sinks, bathtubs, and showers. Removing unwanted hair that clogs our drains. I invented a tool that stays in your drain,  collects all the hair and then you pull it out once a month and empty it. My invention prevents clogged drains, helps keep hair out of the sewer system or septic tank and makes the job of cleaning your drain much easier and way less GROSS!
