This project is about alternative ways to heat the water you use in your home.
In your home the water heater makes the water hot but what makes the heater work, I wanted to know if there were alternative ways to heat the water.
I learned that darker color bags as warmed the water to a hotter temp. than lighter colored bags.
If we ever needed to go completely solar, I will have a solution for heating the water in my home.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
