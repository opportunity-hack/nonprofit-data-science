The project that I did is named Liquid Power.  The purpose of this project was to see if different liquids affect the way that a model hydraulic elevator functions. I started with the project by building a model hydraulic elevator with popsicle sticks. I put tubing which connected two different syringes with the liquids in it that would power the structure. Once the elevator was made, I started the trials of the project. With each trial, I began by testing the most common liquid, the water. I then continued with the other liquids, sparkling water, maple syrup, and veggie oil. With each liquid, I tested how tall they made the structure go. From this experiment, I found the results that the maple syrup and veggie oil’s density created air bubbles in the tubing. This made the structure of the elevator unable to go to its max height with the two liquids, causing it to reach the height of 10 inches. Meanwhile, the water and sparkling water reached the same maximum height of 11 inches. During the project, I noticed that the wooden skewers connecting the two parts of the structure, started to bow.  In the future, to improve this project, I could find a solution to make that section of the structure stronger.  This could possibly be replacing the skewers with dowels because they are stronger wood.  In the end, I was taught from this project that the type of liquid used, can effect the function of a hydraulic elevator.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
