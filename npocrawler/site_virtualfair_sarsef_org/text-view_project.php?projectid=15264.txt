Grade:
5

Teacher:
Alessandra Campos

My project is about how music affects people's emotions. I picked this project because I like music. My overall conclusion is that people can easily identify happy and sad emotions in music. My project is important because it could help use music for therapy.

Keywords: music, emotion
This project has been cleared by SRC.
