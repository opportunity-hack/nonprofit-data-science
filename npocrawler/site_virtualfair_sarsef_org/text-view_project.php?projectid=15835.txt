HS-AS010
Active Sensing for the Big Brown Bat (Eptesicus fuscus) When Faced With Unpredictable Situations
Animal Science

Zander Bryan Reed Dickey
Grade:
HS

Teacher:
Christopher Chen

1. My project is focusing on how an unpredictable environment affects the pulse rate and the variance in the pulse rate for the bat. 
2. I chose this project because I have been interested in researching the bat since I first learned about echolocation. This provided me an opportunity I could not pass up. 
3. I found that when faced with an unpredictable environment, the bat decreases the pulse rate and the variance in the pulse rate. 
4. This project allows us to research the behaviors in the bat, and apply them to other species.
This project has been cleared by SRC.


Comments

This is an interesting project and very well designed display.  I wondered how you defined unpredictable  environment and whether you created the unpredictable one or just waited for one to happen.
