Effect Weight Has on an Airplane

 I wanted to know if the weight on an airplane causes the airplane to fly a farther distance or a shorter distance. I sometimes want to make an airplane that flies far and I wondered if a paper clip in front of a airplane really does make it go farther. Some questions I asked myself are: Will weight in in the middle affect the distance a paper airplane flies? Does more weight in the middle of a paper airplane make it go farther? Does more weight on a paper airplane make it more stable?
This project has been cleared by SRC.
