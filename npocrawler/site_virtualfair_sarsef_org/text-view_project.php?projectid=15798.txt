What a great way to make good use of your local environment to ask a good question.
Props to you for raising your own chickens and using their eggs for your family!
What a smart and useful project! Well done!
Great idea. Good luck. I hope you make a big discovery.
Very important research given the high interest in growing your own foods. Good to know which is better.
