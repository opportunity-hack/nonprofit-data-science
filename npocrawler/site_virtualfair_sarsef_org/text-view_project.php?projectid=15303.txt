HS-EA007
Temperature's Effects on the Alkalinity of Seawater
Earth and Environmental Science

Grade:
HS

Teacher:
Dr. Mary G Lyons

The purpose of the project is to study the effect of global warming and increase in temperature on seawater's alkalinity.  I chose to do this project out of curiosity about global warming and it's effect on the ocean.  The hypothesis is supported, increased temperature decreases the total alkalinity of the seawater.  The decrease in alkalinity is detrimental to ocean chemistry, which could significantly increase the rate of ocean acidification.

KEYWORDS:  seawater alkalinity, ocean acidification, global warming
This project has been cleared by SRC.
