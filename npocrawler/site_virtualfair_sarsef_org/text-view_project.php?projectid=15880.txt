1. My project will attempt to show which public places are being well sanitized and which need improvement.

2. I chose this project because the current pandemic made me curious about how germs spread.

3.  My experiment successfully showed that some of our public places are better sanitized than others.

4.  My project is important because it shows that we must always protect ourselves against germs.

Keywords:  germs, sanitize, pandemic
This project has been cleared by SRC.
