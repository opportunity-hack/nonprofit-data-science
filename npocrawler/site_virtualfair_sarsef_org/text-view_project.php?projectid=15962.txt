What Do Plants Grow Best In?
Animal and Plant Sciences

Grade:

Teacher:
Tara Wieber

I wanted to know which materials will help plants grow best. I chose it because I love plants. I learned that pansies grow the best in soil in Arizona. This project is important because people want their plants to be healthy and look good.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

I love plants, too!
Look forward to seeing you grow cactus next year!
