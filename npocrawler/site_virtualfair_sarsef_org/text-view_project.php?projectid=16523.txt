Are All Sugars the Same?
Chemical Science

Pamela Buchanan Class
Grade:

Teacher:
Pamela Buchanan

Students will be testing sugars in honey, table sugar, and fruit juice to see if they are all the same.  They will be using "Reagent tablets" for the tests.  Students also wanted to learn about the types of sugar we eat, and why some sugar is important to our bodies.
