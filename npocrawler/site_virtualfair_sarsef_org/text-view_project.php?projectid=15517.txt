Hamster Night Light
Energy and Environmental Engineering

Grade:

Teacher:
Ms. Wermuth

My idea was to create a way for when my hamster runs on his wheel creating kinetic energy to go through my project to turn into electrical energy powering a mini light bulb. My purpose of doing this experiment is because I saw a person on TV power a toy robot with her hamster running on his wheel, so I thought if a hamster could power a toy robot my hamster might be able to power a mini light bulb. In conclusion my project failed but I won because I learned so much more about science and I had a really fun time with my dad and hamster doing this project. We tried everything we could think of to make it work but we couldn’t make it work. My hamster (Charles) is the smallest and fastest type of hamster because of him being so tiny he couldn’t push that much weight.
This project has been cleared by SRC.


Comments

Even though Charles was unable to light your bulb, I think your idea could definitely work. It's a great concept. Keep up the scientific thinking and experimentation and you'll go far!
