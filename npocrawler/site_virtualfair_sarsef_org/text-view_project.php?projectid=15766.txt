The blood type correlation experiment was constructed under the pretenses of the COVID-19 virus and its severe effect on the human body. As the virus continues to be highly contagious, it was imperative that research was done on behalf of the human population that would help bring more clarity. Within our community, it seemed as though a pattern was starting to emerge with the symptoms of the COVID-19 virus. This pattern was unknown to the human eye, however, genetically the pattern was more severe in certain individuals. My partner and I created a survey that would take into consideration all factors scientists have proven affect the way the virus mutates in the human bloodstream. With the survey, we correlated the type of blood a human has to the severity of the virus. O positive showed an increase of days with Covid-19 symptoms compared to the other blood types.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
