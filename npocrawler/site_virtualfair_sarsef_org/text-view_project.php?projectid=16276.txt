Water is a vital resource. However, this precious liquid is being wasted in sinks, showers, and toilets with no reuse. Although 60 to 65 percent of this greywater has the potential for reuse, under 1 percent of water used in the U.S. is recycled water. The purpose of this experiment was to harness the potential of this greywater by creating a miniature water turbine for use in household outflow pipes. Five hand-made prototypes were created and tested by spinning the turbine with a drill. Then, the final prototype, which successfully produced a voltage with a drill, was tested with water. The final prototype was unable to produce electricity when tested with water. Although the goal of this experiment was not achieved, this study demonstrated the possibility of such a turbine being created with further refinements to the prototype created.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
