The goal of our project was to find out if fruit flies prefer certain types of fruit. After a first experiment in glass jars, we had so many fruit flies that reproduced, that we decided to start a follow-up experiment. This second experiment asked if fruit flies prefer or avoid specific places in our home.We choose this project because fruit flies are genetically similar to humans and we can learn from them about human diseases. Also, they are reproducing very quickly so it's easy to conduct controlled experiments with them. The overall conclusion from this experiment was that fruit files prefer pineapple and tomato. Also, we observed that they avoid the area close to the internet WiFi router. Our findings suggest that the internet WiFi routers might be unhealthy for flies and potentially also for people, given their genetic similarity.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
