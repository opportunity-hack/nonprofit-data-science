Are Gluten Free Flours Actually Gluten Free?
Biochemical Science and Bioengineering

1. What is your project about?

My project is about testing gluten free flours to see if they are actually gluten free. 


2. Why did you choose this project?

I chose this project because Gluten and Gluten sensitivity was something I had never learned about before, so choosing this helped me to learn more about it. 


3. What was your result/ overall conclusion?

My result was correct, it supported my hypothesis that the gluten-free Almond Flour did not have gluten. Therefore, these selected flours are not false advertising.


4. Why is your project important?

My project is important because it helps those who suffer from Gluten sensitivity. These people need to adapt their diets because if they are unknowingly consuming Gluten, there can be severe consequences, and they can sometimes even die. This way, they know that they are eating what they think they’re eating.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
