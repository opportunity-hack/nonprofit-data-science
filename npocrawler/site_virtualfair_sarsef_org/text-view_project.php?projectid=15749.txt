The purpose of this experiment was to identify if people of higher age groups, that were infected with the Coronavirus, had lower oxygen levels than those that were younger and also infected with the same strand of the virus. Five family members tested positive for the Coronavirus and quarantined together for 14 days. Starting on day 3, each family member recorded their oxygen levels at 10 am using an oximeter since some of them were having a little more difficulty breathing. The older members of the family had oxygen levels of 90-95%, while the younger members had 95-99%. The family recorded their data daily until day 14 of quarantine. Further studies on testing household units would be beneficial to determine any consistent trends of the various age groups.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
