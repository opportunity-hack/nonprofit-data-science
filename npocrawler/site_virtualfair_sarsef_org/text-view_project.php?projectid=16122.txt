1. What is your project about?
My project tested 3D printed face shields vs employer provided face shields to those on
the front lines of treating COVID-19 during a PPE shortage. This was to test which was
more comfortable and provided quality protection.
2. Why did you choose this project?
I chose this project because of the global pandemic and I wanted to see whether 3D
printed, or employer provided PPE felt more effective and comfortable. I also wanted to
provide face shields to my grandmother, who is a nurse, and her co-workers as they did
not have them.
3. What was your result/overall conclusion?
The result of my project was that based on the 3D printed face shields I provided and
the surveys completed, the 3D printed PPE was more comfortable and provided quality
protection.
4. Why is your project important?
My project is important to help doctors and nurses on the front line during the COVID19 pandemic feel more comfortable, and safer. I was able to provide quality face shields
that provided protection and kept people from getting the virus.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
