Which Mask Is Safest?
Health and Wellness

Grade:

My project is dealing with the most common types of masks (bandana, surgical, Cloth, and N95) used daily, and putting them to the test to see if which of the masks are the most resistant to letting breath out through them.
I chose this project because the result of this project could benefit and help people who work in offices and workforces daily, and have to wear a mask every time they are out of the house to understand which types of masks are the safest to wear.
The N95 mask was the most resistant to breath coming through the mask, followed by the surgical mask, cloth mask, and finally the bandana.
This project could benefit people who do work in offices, and who are out of the house daily, and since the COVID protocol is high, it is important to know which masks could benefit your safety in the long run, and which mask could lead to a much more damaging result.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
