Many pet owners have had a mischievous cat that enjoyed unrolling the toilet paper and making a mess on the bathroom floor.  That's why we created the Bad Kitty T.P. Guard.  This simple device will prevent your kitty from getting its paws on the toilet paper, but still allows the human to access and use the toilet paper.  It is easy to apply and does not require modification of typical residential toilet paper holders.
