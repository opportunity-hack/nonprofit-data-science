Well, there is a show on Disney Plus called "Into the Unknown." As you can guess, the show is about the making of the movie, Frozen 2 “behind Frozen 2”. In the show, all of the Frozen characters/actors are filmed in the recording studio. In the recording studio the actors go to this tiny office and in the office there are special walls, that look like dressing screen panels that surround the actors so they are in small spaces. What I understand is that they are in small spaces so their voice sounds louder and stronger.
What I know is that when I watch my singing videos on my YouTube channel my voice doesn't sound powerful and it sounds like the high-pitched voice of a small child. And in those videos you will notice that all the surroundings that I am singing in are larger spaces, so I am thinking that from now on I should make my videos from in a small surroundings, maybe even closed in spaces.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
