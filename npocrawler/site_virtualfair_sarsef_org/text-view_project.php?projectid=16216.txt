Practicing basketball shots always includes chasing the ball, even when the shot is made. This leads to early fatigue and less practice. By creating an Automatic Rebounder that sends the ball back if the shot is made the problem was solved. The Automatic Rebounder can greatly improve basketball practice for professional and non-professional players.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
