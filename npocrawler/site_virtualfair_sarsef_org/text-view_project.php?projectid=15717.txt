Can Green Beans Grow in Materials Around the House?

My project was about discovering if you can grow green beans in other household materials.
I chose this project to see if green beans can grow in soil like materials. 
The green beans grew pretty good, the corn kernels didn't sprout and the coffee grounds sprouted but they didn't grow much. I think my project is important because now that we know that you can grow green beans in paper face masks and cotton balls you don't have to use potting soil.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

This was an excellent project topic and your photos were great additions to your project. Great job! I really liked the detail you provided in your research. Also, that was neat how the corn sprouted!
