What effects does cryopreservation has on the germination of seeds? Is there any way to speed up the germination rate of a cryopreserved seeds? Cryopreserved seeds allows our scientist to explore and discover more of the mystery of evolution and lets us have a chance to preserve extinct/almost extinct plants. But have you ever thought about the next global catastrophe? Thanks to the cryopreservation of seeds, we might be able to have nourishment if any unexpected or natural disaster ever happens. The real question is, if we can speed up the growth of those seeds? Can we use a growth hormone on cryopreserved seeds to prove the germination of the plant? This project investigated the use of gibberellic acids on promoting the germination of cryopreserved seeds.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
