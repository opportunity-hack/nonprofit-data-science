Recycled Racer Project

Grade:

Teacher:
Aleza Schultz

I designed a toy race car out of recycled materials. I wanted to design a toy that was safe for little kids and safe for the environment. I learned that patience, measurement, and accuracy are really important in the design process. Most importantly, this project teaches that mistakes are not failures - they are opportunities to learn what works even better.
