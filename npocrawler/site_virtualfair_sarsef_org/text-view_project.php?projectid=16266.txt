Aspirin Absorbance in Different Liquids
Health and Wellness

Teacher:
Alicia Barrios

The main purpose of my project is seeing which liquid will help aspirin dissolve the quickest. This is important because in heart attacks that many people have, aspirin can help you survive. But aspirin takes awhile to dissolve, so I am seeing exactly which liquid will help dissolve the fastest so the aspirin can be more efficient.
This project has been cleared by SRC.


Comments

Your presentation was complete and nicely put together.  I learned that lemonade and apple juice are not good to take with aspirin.   I liked that you learned from your experiment. Good job!
