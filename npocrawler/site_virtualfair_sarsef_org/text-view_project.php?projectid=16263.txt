Oven Versus Balloons

My experiment was to compare how different types of balloons will react to a hot summer day in a car, but instead of using a car I will use my oven.
First, when I was researching how hot a car can get on a summer day, I realized that it could be very hot. The highest temperature a car reached on a summer day was 172 degrees F, I was amazed at what I learned about different temperatures.
Second, when i was researching different types of balloons i could use, i found latex balloons, mylar balloons, and plastic balloons. I didn't use plastic balloons for the project because I wanted each balloon to be the same diameter but unfortunately the plastic balloons were extremely small, so I decided not to use them
I believe that information is very important because that experiment reveals which balloons are best to purchase on a very hot day.
This project has been cleared by SRC.


Comments

Good work, appropriate for hot desert summers
This information could is useful for those of us in AZ - I will keep this in mind when purchasing balloons for summer parties!
