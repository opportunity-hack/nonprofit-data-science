Pancreatic cancer has the lowest survival rate of all cancers, despite therapy. It is known to specifically resist immunotherapy due to the presence of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), whose higher presence correlates with a decreased immune response. This study investigates if the drug cabozantinib may play a role in reducing the tumor-promoting effects of MDSCs by targeting the levels of MDSCs in the pancreatic tumor microenvironment (TME). Tumor organoids, miniature lab-grown tumors made from patient-derived cancer cells, were used in this study to compare cancer cells exposed to cabozantinib and those left untreated via immunofluorescent imaging. The results indicate that a combinatorial treatment by depleting MDSC levels and inhibiting PD-1/PD-L1 interactions is necessary to target PD-L1 expressing pancreatic cancer cells and induces tumor death. These findings may provide valuable information to target MDScs in pancreatic cancer and increase tumor response to immunotherapy, leading to improved patient survival.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
