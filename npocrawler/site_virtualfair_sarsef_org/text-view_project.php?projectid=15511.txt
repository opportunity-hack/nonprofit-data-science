People who use online platforms need to have an easier place to put their web cameras. Researchers sketched many ideas but selected one that used a command strip for the mount and was the most useful for as many mounts as possible.  The final design looked like Mickey Mouse with a square ear. When tested it held onto the camera amazingly well, was easy to hold, and was able to be put in different areas at different angles better!
This project has been cleared by SRC.

I absolutely love this idea!!! I have my web camera mounted to my monitor using two squeeze clamps, your design allows several mounting angles! Keep up the good work and inventions! Judge Tom
