My project compares three kinds of ancient siege weapons to identify the most effective.  I chose this project because I am interested in them and the physics behind them.  This project is important because it demonstrates different physics behind launching a projectile.  The result was that the catapult was the most effective.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
