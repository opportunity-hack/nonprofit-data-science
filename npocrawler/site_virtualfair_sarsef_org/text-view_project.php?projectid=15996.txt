My project was about how long until you should wash it. I thought it would be fun topic and fun to do. You should probably wash your mask at least every day. It's important to take care of your mask, especially during this pandemic.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Cool.  I have often wonder this myself, good to know that if I wear it- wash it.  But if I need it all day, it's not much worse than just a couple of hours.  Great job, Thanks!!
