Effects of the Use of Headphones on Auditory Memory Retention
Behavioral and Social Science

Grade:
8

Teacher:
Ivan D Yocum

1. My project is about studying the effects of the use of headphones on auditory memory
retention and to observe if using headphones could help people retain information
more effectively.
2. I chose this project because it came from personal observations when my school
switched to remote learning. When we first switched to remote learning, I used
headphones to listen to my teachers while they were lecturing and later realized that
how I heard sounds while wearing headphones was different than how it was when I
was in a classroom. It was personally harder for me to retain information so I then
started to attend class without wearing headphones. Ever since, I have continued to
not use headphones but the mini experiment led me to being interested in conducting
this experiment.
3. My result/overall conclusion is that by wearing headphones, it will be more effective
in helping people retain verbal information, rather than wearing no headphones.
4. My project is important because most schools are doing remote learning, and I want
the result of my project to be useful to others and to help them.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
