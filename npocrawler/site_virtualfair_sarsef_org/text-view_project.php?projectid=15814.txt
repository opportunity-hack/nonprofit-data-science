This engineering project stems from the idea of creating a way to breathe underwater so that there could be possibilities of expanding submarine bases under the ocean. The prototype was designed to show how to get oxygen from water using balloons, tubes and a power supply. Although a couple of  improvements were made, there wasn’t enough gas to inflate the balloon.  The next steps to the prototype indicate the trial of using lower voltage from the power supply and different electrodes to get the results desired.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Love the research put into this project. Makes me want to experiment with this topic also. Well done!
The way you made improvements from 1 to 2 was very well done!
