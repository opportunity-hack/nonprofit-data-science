I chose to do this project because I wanted to see if I could find the answer to  my interesting thought of when I bounced a ball in different temperatures.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

This looked liked a very fun project!  Good job!
Great job! I wonder what the effect would be if you put the balls in liquid nitrogen (-320 deg.F) and then ran the same test?  Would you get any bounce at all?
