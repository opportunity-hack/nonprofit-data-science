My project is about trying to find the variables to best eliminate pressure drag. I launched an object with a pyramid shaped tail, and then a prism shapes tail. I chose this project because pressure drag interested me, and it's also one of the more independent forms of drag, making it easier to test. My results showed that there was barely any different from the prims shaped tail and the pyramid shaped tail. There were outside variables like human error and inconsistent densities of the objects, so there was no real way to draw a conclusion. This project is important because it can help determine the best shape for eliminating pressure drag specifically.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

I really enjoyed your use of math, including setting up and solving equations. Great work!
