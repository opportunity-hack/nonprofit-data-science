This project will examine the durability and dissolvability of rocks. I chose this project because I am interested in geology and how our planet will change in the future. The project likely did not have enough time to measure changes but many rocks did undergo changes- like the earth. It is important because it could teach scientists about the relationships between different rocks and certain liquids because it could inform us about how quickly our earth can change.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

You have a great start to a geology career
A great start towards a career in geology, good work!
How does pollution factor in to your experiment? Good job. Well thought out and researched. TGMS Anna.
Great job!! I think you should keep developing this idea...you should shake each jar the same amount daily to see if the liquid breaks the rocks down
In nature, wind, water and sun all contribute to the weathering & erosion of rocks. You've got a good start here. Take it to the next level. Use a fan for the wind.
Set the rocks in the sunlight. Agitate them to simulate movement from their place of origin. See what happens if use igneous and metamorphic rocks.
