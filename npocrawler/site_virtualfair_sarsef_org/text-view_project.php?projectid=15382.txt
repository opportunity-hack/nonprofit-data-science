PK-HW001
Which Mouth Is More Dirty: Mine or My Dog’s?
Health and Wellness

Ella Winter
Grade:
PK

Teacher:
Megan Winter

This is a student at Valley View Early Learning Center (CFSD). She is a homeschool entry because VVELC does not do science fair.**
She likes to give her dog kisses. She had heard that a dog’s mouth is cleaner than a human’s mouth.  She wanted to know if this is true. She wondered, “Which mouth is more dirty- hers or her dog’s?” She found that both mouths had germs in them, but her dog had more grow. This means her dog’s mouth might actually be “more dirty”.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

What a fantastic project, thank you!
Great job! Nice to see a young student working with a professional scientist. Good opportunity for mentoring.
What a great idea! The colors of your presentation are fun and I love the detail of your procedure. You clearly thought through every step carefully.
What a great experiment.  I’ve often wondered this very same thing.  Thank you for answering this question for me.  I look forward to you answering more science questions in the future.  Well done!
Very weird but creative experiment! I liked all of the innovation and ideas you used here!
Great job with this!  You were curious about whether to believe dog's mouths are cleaner and you put it to the test - such an awesome project!  I've always wondered if this was true, too!
Wow, love the idea for this project!! Our dogs like to give kisses too!
