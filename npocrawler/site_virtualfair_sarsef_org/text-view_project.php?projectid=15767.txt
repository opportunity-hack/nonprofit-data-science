Electrolytes are needed for your body to function. There are a lot of advertisements that tell us that as we exercise, we need to replace the electrolytes that our body loses through sweat. There are many products that are designed to do that. Which is why I choose and believe this project is important. One way to measure the relative amount of electrolytes is to measure the conductivity of the drinks. Therefore my experiment is meant to compare some of these products and measure the electrolytes in each one. After testing my experiment I discovered my hypothesis was incorrect and orange juice has the most electrolytes.  In conclusion my project was meant to experiment and learn which drink would have the most electrolytes to replace the ones lost from sweat.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
