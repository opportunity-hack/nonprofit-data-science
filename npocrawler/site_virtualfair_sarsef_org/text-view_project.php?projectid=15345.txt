Nowadays, drinking water from water fountains is really risky and even more with the virus going on. We never know if the water we drink publically is completely clean. Moreover, the purpose of this research was to prove if drinking water fountains from different locations in cities, Yuma and San Luis would have safe potable water. This project was conducted using the following methods. First, get a piece of paper and write down the name of the places where water will be tested. Then, gather all materials to start experiment. Collect water samples from the places listed in Yuma and San Luis. Make sure to get the same amount of water for each water sample. After that, label all water samples with the locations where they were taken. Lastly, purchase a water testing kit and test and record the potability of water. The results of this experiment showed that from drinking water fountains in Yuma County, Walmart ‘’B’’ had the most potable and clean water. In addition, from San Luis Arizona, Walmart also had the best water potability. In conclusion, drinking from water fountains is not completely safe, which proves my hypothesis correct. The city that was proven to have a greatly potability of water of both cities was San Luis Arizona.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
