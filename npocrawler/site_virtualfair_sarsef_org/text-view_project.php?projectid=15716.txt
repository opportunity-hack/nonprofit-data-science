This project is about the antibiotic effects of flavonoids. I chose this project because microbiology and the study of diseases intrigues me. My experiment found that flavonoids are not more successful than chemical antibiotics. My project is important because it can further research into diseases and help prevent sickness and death in the future.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
