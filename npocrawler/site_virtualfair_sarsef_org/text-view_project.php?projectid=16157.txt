HS-HB025
The Effect of an HVAC System on Airborne Particle Dispersion
Health and Biomedical Science

Caitlin Hirabayashi
Grade:
HS

Teacher:
Michael Frank, PhD

My project was about how an HVAC system would contribute to airborne particle dispersion. This seemed like an important topic to cover in light of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus, otherwise known as COVID-19. Overall, I determined that the system, though meant for spreading air around a room, did not have a significant effect on dispersing airborne particles. This is important for people to know because it means that safe social/ physical distancing should be practiced when interacting with others to stop the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
