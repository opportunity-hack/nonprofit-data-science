HS-AS011
The Effects of Canine and Feline Obesity on Further Health Issues Decreasing Lifespans
Animal Science

Rachael Valenzuela-Kennedy
Grade:
HS

Teacher:
Elyse Wexler

This project is about how canine and feline obesity rates are beginning to mirror the rising rates seen in humans which is not good for their health. I chose this project because the study of animal health issues is commonly avoided by scientists but many of their health issues can be fixed with similar treatments as human health issues. I found that the causes and effects of companion animal obesity is very similar to humans.This research is important to me because animals deserve to live happy, healthy lives and with this research we are one step closer to giving them the medical attention they deserve.

Feline - Cat
Obesity - A disorder involving excessive body fat that increases the risk of health problems.
