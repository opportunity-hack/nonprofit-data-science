The big idea stems from an inquiry of how water creates different geological formations underground. This experiment tests the formation of stalactites on two different types of materials to find out which material stalactites would grow better on.  The idea revolves around the knowledge of stalactites and stalagmites formation in caves. Using household items of baking soda and water to test the hypothesis, it was concluded that stalactites formed better on the material of colored yarn rather than brown jute cord over the course of 30 days. Although real stalactite formations take thousands of years, modeling the process still shows how important water is in the formation.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Great job putting clear pictures into the project and explaining thoroughly what's going on. Stalactites seem so fascinating!
What a fun project.  It brought back many memories, as I grew up in the Ozarks and visited many caves. Great work!
