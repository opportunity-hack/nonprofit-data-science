HS-BE010
The Impact of Self-Esteem on STEM Career Choices for Different Gender/Ethnic Group
Behavioral and Social Science

Isabella Mixton-Garcia, Auhona Shil
Grade:
HS

Teacher:
Elyse Wexler

Our project determined which STEM career had the most workers for different gender/ethnic groups as a result of self-esteem. We chose this project because during this pandemic time, mental health is a big issue and we wanted to connect it to an aspect of daily life. Our conclusion was that the percentage of workers who were engineers had a higher correlation to self-esteem. As both of us are females in ethnic minorities, we know that ethnic/gender minorities usually get lower paying jobs in the engineering field. With our research, career counselors can implement self-esteem improving techniques to allow ethnic/gender minorities to get higher paying engineering jobs, which would create a more diverse workforce.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

I love the idea of exploring mental health affects on future choices.  I'm also glad to see that lower self esteem didn't deter any one career field.  Thank you, well done!
You did an amazing job presenting this data!  From a woman in science thank you for doing this incredible work!  Mrs. Wexler
