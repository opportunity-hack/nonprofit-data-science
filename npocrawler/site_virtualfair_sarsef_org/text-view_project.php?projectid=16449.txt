1.The purpose of my project is to figure out if music effects memory.
2. I chose this project because I was looking into better ways to prepare for tests and listening to music was one of the ways that was said that helped.  
3. The result of my experiment was In all people the times that were the highest, were the ones that played music, showing that music had a negative effect on concentration.
4. My project is important because this experiment helps to find better ways to study, and retain information.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
