Scribble, Scribble, Scribble: Looking for a New System of Drawing Congressional Districts so Gerrymandering Cannot Affect Our Elections
Behavioral and Social Science

Grade:
8

Teacher:
Mrs. Lara Huetter

In my project, I tried to solve the problem of gerrymandering affecting our elections. I chose this project because it is a major problem in our country. My hypothesis was proven incorrect, and the system I came up with did not work but I gained enough information to come up with a new system.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

This is such an important topic to research with real-world impact. Keep searching for a non-partisan solution!
Love this!
Awesome job!

Great job! I’m glad young people are looking into solving this problem.
