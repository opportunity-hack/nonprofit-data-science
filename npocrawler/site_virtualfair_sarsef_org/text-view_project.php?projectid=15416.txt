HS-EA017
The Effect of the Melting of Antarctica's Ice on Global Wild Fish Yield
Earth and Environmental Science

Joel Davis
Grade:
HS

Teacher:
Elyse Wexler

My project is about how the glaciers in Antarctica are melting and how it is decreasing fish population and therefore decreasing the amount of fish that can be caught in the wild. I chose this topic because Antarctica is not talked about enough when talking about the issue of Climate Change. My end result was that as the thickness of Antarctica's ice decreases, the global wild fishing yield also decreases. My project is important because people often talk about Climate Change and Global Warming, but since their local environment has not changed dramatically they are not as aware of the issue, but if they were able to see how glaciers are melting and how we are using artificial fish farming as our main way of seafood  production there is now a visual representation that can motivate people to be more mindful of their carbon footprint and pollution.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
