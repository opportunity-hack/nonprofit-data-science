My project is about creating electricity using coins as a battery.  I thought it was cool and interesting.  I was able to create electricity from 22 cents and discovered the more pennies and nickels I use the more electricity I create.  It is important to know how electricity works and how easy a battery is created.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Great work.  Were the coins damaged by the experiment?  Can you still spend them?  I like how you
used graphing to show your results.  Did you measure current?
What a great project! I like your hypothesis of how much it costs, meaning how many coins, to make electricity. Your cost was so close! Great process and thinking throughout the experiment.
