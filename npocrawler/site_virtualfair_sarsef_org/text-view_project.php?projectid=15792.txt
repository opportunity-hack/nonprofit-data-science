Have you ever wondered if caffeine could affect plants the same way it could affect humans? I wondered too. One of the first things I did was research how humans can react to caffeine. Understanding the effects caffeine has on our bodies I moved on to doing the science fair project. I used plain water, coffee, and a water caffeine mixture and gave it to the corresponding plants. Over the course of the three weeks I watched these plants grow and recorded the data. I measured the plants by pot and added up their total growth through the week then I divided the number by 10 to find the average. My results were that caffeine does affect plants similarly to humans. It can stunt and even prevent growth and make it hard for the plants to meet the average growth. My hypothesis was that coffee would help the plants grow the most because an effect of caffeine on humans is increased alertness and productivity. However the results were that water had the most growth, the coffee plant was an inch behind in growth, and the caffeine plants didn’t grow at all. Overall this project showed me that plants and humans react similarly to caffeine.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
