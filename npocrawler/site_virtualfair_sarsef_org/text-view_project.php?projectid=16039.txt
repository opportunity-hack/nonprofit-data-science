HS-EA027
The Effect of Ant Tunnel Lengths Based on the Material the Ants Live On
Earth and Environmental Science

Jose Eduardo Tanori
Grade:
HS

Teacher:
Elyse Wexler

This project is about the success of ants in different material landscapes which is determined by the length of their tunnels. I chose this project because it seemed very interesting especially because ants are the perfect creature to test since they are very independent. My overall conclusion of this project is that ants do best in dirt. My project is important because it helps us inform ourselves about one of the smallest creatures on earth and their preferences.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
