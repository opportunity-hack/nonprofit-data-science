7-CH002
Do Different Types of Glue Affect the Construction of Slime?
Chemical Science

Grade:

Teacher:
Ms. Wermuth

1. My project is about if you can make slime with Wood, Fabric, and Tacky glues and see if they are still able to play with or to use as a stress relief item. 2. I choose this project because I wanted to know if you can still make slime with different types of glue instead of School glue. 3. The result was that the Wood and Tacky glues made slime while the Fabric glue didn’t make slime. 4. My project was important because I wanted to let people know if you can still make slime without using School glue, which a lot of people use to make slime with.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
