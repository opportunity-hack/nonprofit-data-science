Soil Water Repellency (SWR) a Case Study of Humic Acid Polymerization After a Wildfire

Elaine MacKenzie

This project covered humic acid polymerization after a wildfire and the subsequent water repellent layer it causes. I chose this project because of the recent Bighorn Fire and the anxiety of potential flash flooding after the fire. I concluded that the increase in naturally occurring humic acid results in an increase in hydrophobicity of the soil, leading to water repellency. This is important because it could be used to zone areas that would have catastrophic flash floods after a fire.
This project has been cleared by SRC.


Comments

I like the way you used photos to help explain your process. They were very helpful in communicating your data.
Amazing project.  You care about this and researched it over a long period of time.  Fantastic lab book. Keep it up!  You are a scientist who can make a real contribution to making our world better.
