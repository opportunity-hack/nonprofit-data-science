Hello, I’m a seventh grader from Borman K8. I’ve always liked playing video games, especially the one I’m using in my experiment.

My experiment is on video games. My mom is the “unpaid volunteer.” My teacher suggested I do this after I told him I liked video games, so I decided to try it out!
This project has been cleared by SRC.
