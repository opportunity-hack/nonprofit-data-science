Impact of Distance Learning on Student’s Academic Performance

Elyse Wexler

My project aimed to discover how high school students have been impacted in the transition to online classes. As a high school student myself who has experienced firsthand the difficulties of attending school from a computer, I wanted to understand better how other students like myself have been impacted. Although I concluded that GPA did not significantly change from in-person to online learning, it was still important to investigate how students have been impacted by the shift to online classes to ensure they got the same quality and quantity of learning.
This project has been cleared by SRC.


Comments

If students can choose, they can do better and are happier! Thatâ€™s great insight. I wonder if districts where students are given distance vs hybrid choices are more successful overall? Hmm ðŸ¤” great job
Such an important study in 2021!  Thank you for your work on this.  Mrs. Wexler
