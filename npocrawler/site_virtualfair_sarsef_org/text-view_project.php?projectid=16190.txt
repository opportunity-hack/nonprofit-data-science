I asked the question “If a custom aquaponics system, scaled up to an acre, produce enough food calories to last a human 6 months?” The data was measured twice, once with the number of calories produced by the normal size aquaponics system, and the other, ‘being scaled up to an acre in size, and then the calories were calculated. The aquaponics system scaled up to an acre was able to produce more than enough calories for one person, in fact it produced enough calories to feed 10 people for 6 months! The constant in my experiment was the number of calories an average human needed to survive. Further studies are needed to see if aquaponics is an effective farming strategy.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
