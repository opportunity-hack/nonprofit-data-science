1) My project examined whether certain substances combined with others would affect freezing point. 
2) I wondered if I could change the time it takes to freeze a popsicle by combining different mixtures. 
3) Citric acids such as lemon or orange fruits, can be mixed with water to create a flavorful popsicle while shortening the freezing time. 
4) This discovery is important because it saves energy and time, not only for people at home, but in industry, too.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
