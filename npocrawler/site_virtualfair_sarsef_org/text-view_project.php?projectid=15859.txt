In this experiment we will find out how drag affects the distance an airplane flies. I chose this project because I wanted to find out what is the affect of drag on the distance a paper airplane flies. I found out that  when I added flaps to my plane the distance went a lot lower than the ones without flaps. I may design planes one day.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Wow, flaps made a big difference.  Great Job!
