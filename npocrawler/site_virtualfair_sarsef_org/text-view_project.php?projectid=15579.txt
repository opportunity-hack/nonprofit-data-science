Out of what materials makes a homemade rocket go far and hit an intended target? In learning about the scientific method, we made rockets out of paper and tag board in class.  They flew every-which-way and we wanted to find out if we could build a rocket out of homemade materials that could fly straight, a certain distance and hit a target. Rockets made out of sturdy paper like toilet/paper towel rolls flew the farthest.  Aim was inconsistent. It's important that objects meant for moving can be directed.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
