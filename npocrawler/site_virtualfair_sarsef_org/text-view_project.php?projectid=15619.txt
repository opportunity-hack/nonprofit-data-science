1. I looked at which study method worked best to help my brother, who has Down Syndrome, memorize math facts. 
2. I chose to do this project because during remote learning I noticed that just memorizing equations did not really work well for him, so I wanted to find out if another method would work better. 
3. I found that looking at equations as pictures was most effective for my brother to remember math facts. 
4. Knowing what study method works best can help teacher develop strategies that help individuals with Down Syndrome to learn.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
