Ever accidentally break you game controller? Well, I left the xBox controller upside down and the button broke so I thought we should have a stand for the controller so that it has a place to sit when we’re done playing. You can buy xBox controller stands but the one that I built also holds my timer and our TV remote. I had an idea in my head and I was able to communicate it to my dad so when we started to build we were on the same page. Cutting the wood was kind of hard but he helped me.
