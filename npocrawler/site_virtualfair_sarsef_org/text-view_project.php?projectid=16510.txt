Ice Melting
Chemical Science

My scientific question is “What type of liquid household items or elements will help the ice melt the fastest?” My project is about what household liquid items can melt ice the fastest.  When you drink soda with ice in it, the ice would melt. Same with water with ice, so I wonder, what liquid can melt the ice the fastest. The results of the experiment might help me someday. I believe it’s important to learn which liquid can melt ice the fastest because there might be an instance where I might want to and when I complete this I’ll know.  It’ll be easier for me when I know what I can use or what I should avoid. The independent variables are the liquids I’ll be using on the ice. It is what’ll help me figure out what liquid can help melt the ice. The dependent variable is the time of each liquid.  It will help by letting me know which liquid melted the ice the fastest. Lastly, the controlled variable is the ice with no liquid in it. The ice with no liquid will help me verify how long it would take for the ice to melt without any liquid. One limitation I had was the weather. However, this limitation didn’t hinder me from finding out what liquid melted the ice first.  I used measuring cups to keep the measurement equal. It took about 3 to 4 hours to finish this project.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
