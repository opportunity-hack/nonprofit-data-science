My project is about a Breakfast Delivery service that brings you
breakfast in bed. I chose this project because I won’t want to leave
my bed to go get breakfast. I was able to make a breakfast delivery
service by using a slinky and paper. My project is important because if
someone got the coronavirus no one could get next to the person so
the person could use the Breakfast Delivery.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

BEST CONCLUSION EVER... I LOVE that you kept trying until something worked! And how much I bet you learned in the process of things that didn't work.  THAT'S SCIENCE!!!
