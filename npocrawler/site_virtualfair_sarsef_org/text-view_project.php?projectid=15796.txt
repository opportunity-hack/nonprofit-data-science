What made a better structure?
Keep using your passion to drive your thinking towards solutions.
I like how you used science to try to deal with the major social problem of homelessness. You have a lot of great data to support your work. Thanks for providing photos to show how you did it. Great!
what's part 1? Great project! Good details! Everything else is fantastic!
