The purpose of this project was to discover which plastic recyclable container shapes are easiest to clean. Having cleaner plastic containers in recycling would increase the amount of plastic able to be recycled. It would also result in a reduction in recycling
contamination. Recycling contamination reduces the recyclability of paper and cardboard, resulting in more waste in landfills. 

I chose this project because I wanted to help the recycling companies and the world. Recycling companies find tons of
contaminated containers every day, and when lots of containers are contaminated, our world cannot have bottles, cups, etc. 

The tests showed that the wide cylindrical mayonnaise container, with no indentations, was easiest to clean. 

If food manufacturers changed to use plastic containers of this shape it could result in an increase in plastic recycling and less recycling contamination.

 My project is important because without recyclable containers, we wouldn’t be able to have cups, bottles, compost, and storage.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
