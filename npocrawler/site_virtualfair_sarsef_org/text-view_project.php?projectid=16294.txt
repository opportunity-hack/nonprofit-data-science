My head is small, so when I put on a hat it goes over my ears. This makes it difficult to wear a hat and a mask at the same time.  Due to Covid-19 we must wear a mask, so I am inventing a hat with a mask attached.  It is called a HASK! I will continue to improve my prototype by adding a small pocket to the side of my hat to store a bottle of hand sanitizer. The most challenging thing was learning how to sew on a button from my grandma.

Your prototype looks amazing! I am sure others have a similar problem during the pandemic.
