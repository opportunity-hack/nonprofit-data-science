My project is about which water filtration material leads to the best drinking water.
I chose this project because I was interested in what happens to our drinking water when we filter it. I also decided on this project because I like chemistry. I enjoy seeing how different substances can change based on what chemical you put in them.
The conclusion I reached was that the activated powdered carbon was a more effective filter. 
My project is important because we need to know what we are putting in our bodies. There are plenty of people in the world who rely on water filters to get clean water, and everyone needs to know which water filter will give them the safest drinking water. In my project I compared two popular water filters to figure out which one is the most efficient and which one results in the cleanest drinking water.
