In this experiment, I will be testing different chocolate flavored bars to observe how it affects the melting point. The purpose of this experiment is to see if milk chocolate, dark chocolate and white chocolate all have the same melting point. I became interested in this experiment when I was thinking about how quickly chocolate melts. I wondered if milk chocolate, dark chocolate and white chocolate all melt at the same point. The information gained through this experiment will clarify if all chocolate flavors melt at the same temperature. ?
This project has been cleared by SRC.
