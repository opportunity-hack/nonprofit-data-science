1.My project is about rockets and seeing which shape of nose cone makes the rocket travel the farthest.
2. I chose this project because I am interested in rockets a traveling to space.
3. My conclusion is that the rounded nose cone shape makes the rocket travel the farthest.
4. My project is important because there has to be a lot of research on rockets to make sure traveling into space is safe for people in the future.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
