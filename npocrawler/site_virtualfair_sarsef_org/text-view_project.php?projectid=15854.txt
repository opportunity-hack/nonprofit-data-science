1. My project is to study how pressure differences change the weather by making a barometer and studying the rise and fall of the water level as the temperature increases or decreases.
2. I like to study weather patterns. Rain and clouds affect my mood.
3. My overall understanding is that the change in temperature will change the air pressure.
4. My participation in this project helped me understand something we take for granted - weather. Air pressure changes can have a big effect on climate change. 
5. I have an intellectual disability - by doing and learning with the right supports, I am able to find meaning and purpose in the world around me.

Keywords: weather, temperature, air pressure, barometer, climate change
