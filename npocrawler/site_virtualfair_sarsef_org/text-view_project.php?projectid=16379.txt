How Do Sugary Drinks Affect the Teeth?
Health and Wellness

My project consists of testing the effects of Soda and Gatorade on human teeth. I used white eggs, as their shells are like our teeth enamel. The eggs were submerged in the above-mentioned drinks for a period of five days and I kept track of their appearance changes and their weight. This project is important to me because I see an Orthodontist regularly and he constantly mentions to stay away from candy and sugary drinks. He explained that oral health is very important to our overall wellness. Keeping our teeth and gums healthy can prevent major illnesses like: Heart Disease, Respiratory Disease and Diabetes. For this experiment, I chose the two drinks that i like the most, but have been told to stay away from. After completing my experiment, I have confirmed that sugary drinks do affect teeth. At the end of my experiment the shells were stained, cracked, their texture had changed and they weighed less. This proves that a prolonged exposure to sugary drinks can cause damage to our teeth and we have to stay cautious of what we expose our teeth to.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
