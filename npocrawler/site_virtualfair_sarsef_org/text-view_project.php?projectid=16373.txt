1.The purpose of my project is to figure out how many times you need to shuffle your cards before they are completely mixed up. 
2. I chose this project because I enjoy playing cards.
3. The result of my experiment  were that it wasn’t the same amount of shuffles each trial and about 3.2 times. 
4. My project is important because it helps people know how many times they need to shuffle their cards.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
