My project is about looking at how emotions affect how we recall memories. Are people able to remember postive or negative memories easier after long periods of time? I chose this project because I was really intested in how memory works and how we make and recall memories. I learned that people in my study remember positive memories over negative ones. This project was important because it thought me about long term memory.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
