HS-EN001
The Impact of a Global Pandemic on Performing Arts: Building Shields to Stop the Spread of Aerosols
Energy and Environmental Engineering

Grade:
HS

Teacher:
Elyse Wexler

The project is about designing and testing different shields to test which design would be best in blocking air that comes from playing a woodwind instrument. The project was chosen to help figure out something to do while in quarantine, without the ability to play and perform in an ensemble or in public. The conclusion is that the larger the sheet that is opposite of the instrument, the better the shield does in protecting the person in the shield, and less transfer in temperature and humidity. That the smaller the connecting angle, the angle created from the middle sheet and outside sheets, the better the shield works to block the transfer of air, temperature, and humidity. Overall, the project continues to work on bettering the music community, and helping to create a safer and healthier environment for creating music with others,
This project has been cleared by SRC.
