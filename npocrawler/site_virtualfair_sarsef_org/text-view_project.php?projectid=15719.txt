Wearing a mask during COVID-19 is not fun at all. For people like me who
have to wear glasses while wearing a mask, it can be very uncomfortable.
The heat from our breath slips out from the top of our mask and causes our
glasses to fog up. For my project, I decided to figure out the most effective
way to keep glasses from fogging up. I tested soap and water, shaving
cream, tighter face masks and surgical masks. My results showed wearing a
surgical mask was the most effective way to keep glasses from fogging up. I
think the surgical mask was best because it has a little bendable piece to
keep your mask on tight and not allow your breath to escape from the top.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
