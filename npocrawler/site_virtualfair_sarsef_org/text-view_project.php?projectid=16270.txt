What battery brand would last the longest? My guess is that the Duracell battery will last the longest because Duracell has been a top brand for many years so they must have good batteries. In conclusion the Duracell battery lasted the longest. My hypothesis is correct that Duracell would last the longest. But just because something is the top brand doesn't mean it won't be bad. For
example the Panasonic brand is a well known battery company but it only lasted a day, which surprised me because all of the batteries lasted for 3 days or more. Today I learned that the best battery out of these four is Duracell. Now people know that having a Panasonic battery in their flashlight which they use a lot will not last long but the Duracell battery will. Flashlights may not be a lot but they sure can get the job done.
This project has been cleared by SRC.


Comments

Do you think you would get the same results had you used flashlights?  Good controlled experiment. Why did you choose AA batteries.  Would you have gotten similar results if you had used AAA batteries
