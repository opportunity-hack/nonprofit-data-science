Eww… Brown Guacamole!
Chemical Sciences

Maria Fallon Class
Grade:

The project is about exploring the browning of guacamole. One of our classmates got delicious guacamole from a local restaurant but didn’t finish all of it. He put it in his fridge, and when he tried to eat it a few days later, it was BROWN. YUCK! Students decided to ask their parents for their tips and tricks for keeping guacamole green. We explored the effect of these ideas on the browning process (layer of water, lime juice, plastic wrap, and avocado pit).
This project has been cleared by SRC.


Comments

Great work getting multiple methods on keeping guacamole green for longer. I will make sure to use plastic wrap from now on!
Good classroom collaboration to solve a common Arizona problem. Brown guacamole is gross.
