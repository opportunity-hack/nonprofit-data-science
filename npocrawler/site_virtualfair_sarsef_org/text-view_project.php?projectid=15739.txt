Since Covid 19 began, we have had to wear masks at school. One
day in P.E. during hybrid schedule, I wondered if wearing our
masks while exercising was harder than not wearing masks. Then
I thought about how different masks might make breathing easier or harder depending on their material and design. All in all I found that masks keep us safe and they do not effect our oxygen intake in a negative way.  Sometimes people say they can't breathe but I was able to see that we are still getting the oxygen we need with masks.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

An original and interesting question to answer! Great work!
Breathability and comfort of masks makes a difference. Good job!
Great project! You chose a real question that you had to answer. Very well done.
This is great research you've done, congratulations! I hope everyone will wear a mask now and not be concerned about  oxygen levels.
A very interesting and timely topic you selected. I learned a lot and was very interested in your findings. Great job!!!
