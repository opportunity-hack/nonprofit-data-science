This project was designed to help find a cheap and earth friendly product that every student could use and make.  I noticed my brother having trouble with his iPad in making sure it was in the correct angle.  My parents were using a plant to help prop it up for him.   Knowing that reduce, reuse, and recycle are a way of life, I looked around my house to find something that everyone had and noticed wire hangers.  Wire hangers are widely available and easy to shape into an iPad holder.  I wanted something that didn’t cost a lot of money to make too.  Using a wire hanger, needle nose pliers, foam and a suction cup, I was able to help my brother and be earth friendly as well.
