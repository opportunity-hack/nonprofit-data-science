Keeping Strawberries Fresh

My project is about keeping strawberries fresh.  I wanted to see if there was a good way to keep strawberries fresh longer.  I tried five techniques to see which worked best.
I chose this project because although my family eats a lot of other produce, I am the only one who eats strawberries, so they go bad because it is hard to eat them fast enough.  I wanted to find a way to waste less of them.
My overall conclusion was that soaking the strawberries in a vinegar and water solution, rinsing them, and storing them in a plastic container with paper towels kept my strawberries fresh the longest.
My project is important because I think many people have the problem of their produce going bad before they get to eat it.  With the information from my project people can keep their strawberries fresh longer, waste less food, and not waste their money.
This project has been cleared by SRC.


Comments

Nicely carried out and well presented.
Very good experiment. I like that you tried so many techniques to preserve the strawberries. I love strawberries and will start storing them in mason jars to keep them longer.
Well designed and good presentation.  Great job!
