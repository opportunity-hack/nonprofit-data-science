My project was about what soda would work the best for a Mentos-powered jet pack. I got interested in this because my uncle showed me a video of someone making a soda explode with Mentos and I wondered what soda worked the best. The result was that Diet Coke worked best and sodas with aspartame and no sugar worked the best. My research will allow other people to get the best results without having to do the research.

Awesome job! I found it interesting that the diet soda achieved a greater reaction! Keep exploring and questioning. Knowledge is power! Good luck with the science fair,
That was really cool! It would be cool to fly with a soda- powered jet pack...
