Which Slime Recipe Has More Volume
Chemical Sciences

I wanted to look at slime recipes to see which ones produced the most slime.
My class did a project with slime and I love slime.
Instead of using contact lens solution as an activator, I
would rather use borax.
Because slime is big business in the toy world.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Oh my gosh! so fun to look at and read, I can't wait to make more slime now! I never thought of adding shaving cream! Great Job!!
Cool slime experiment! We learned that shaving cream adds more volume to slime than glitter.
