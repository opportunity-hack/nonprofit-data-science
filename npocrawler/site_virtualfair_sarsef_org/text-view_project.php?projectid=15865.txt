Abstract
The purpose of this project is to help to find out if Mylar balloons help gardens grow faster and better. Research about balloon pollution had been done previously in an engineering project and we knew that we could help lessen this type of pollution by reusing the material and not releasing them into the air. One way to reuse Mylar balloons from celebrations is to make them as reflective backgrounds for plants in a garden.  You can manipulate light to achieve different growth patterns. The results of our project showed that the plants with the Mylar background did not sprout faster than the plants without the background. The results also revealed that the Mylar plants had a slower growth rate than the non-Mylar plants over the course of 12 days. The average height of the plants with a Mylar background was about 1.5 inches while the average height of plants without the Mylar background was about 2 inches.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

My family are gardeners, so your project was very interesting to us.  You did well with your scientific method and willingness to challenge your original hypothesis.  Keep up the great work!
I like how unique this project was
