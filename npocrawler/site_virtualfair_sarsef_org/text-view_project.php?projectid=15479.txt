HS-PM005
Effect of an Arrow Shaft and Projectile Point on a Flight’s Precision and Scalar Distance

1) My project is about the effect of and arrow shaft's length and arrowhead on the arrows overall performance in trials of distance and accuracy
2) I chose this project because I am able to use my bow and arrows for an actual project and because I genuinely wanted to see if there would be any change in my arrows' performance if i change there parts out with a different arrows parts. 
3) The overall result of the project was that while changing the arrows length and it's arrowhead did have some affect on its performance, they didn't have as much affect on it as the weight they carried did.
4) My project is important because it can help beginner archers find some good combinations for a few different types of situations they may find themselves in and it can provided researchers more data if they happen to work on a similar project and want more of a specific trial done.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
