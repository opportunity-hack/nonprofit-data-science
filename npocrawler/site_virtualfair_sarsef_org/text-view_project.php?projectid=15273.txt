My project is based off the protein in Neurological disease FTD and how we could detect FTD its early stages  in a fly larvae model. I chose this project because finding more information about FTD is important and could impact many lives thru this research by giving more insight and in an Adult fly it is shown that TDP-43 is mislocalized  just like in FTD .My results were that TDP-43 is not mislocalized in a  fly larvae model meaning you cannot detect these diseases in early stages. My project is important because detecting FTD in early stages would lead us to have research for possible testing's in kids and teenagers to slow down the spread and find a possible cure.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
