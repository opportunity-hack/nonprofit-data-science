The Science of Color Vision

Grade:

One thing that I noticed while calculating the results was that it was more accurate to say that people who were exposed
to more daylight than others were more likely to see brighter colors. I noticed it doesn’t necessarily mean that if you average 4 hours
of sleep you’ll only see dark colors, but rather the amount and type of light you’re exposed to more often. My hope is that my
experiment can be of some use to future research projects on the science of color perception, and the many theories surrounding
mental processing of chromatic signals. Color vision seems to be a less studied or well known field of science, so experiments
where people test out theories and see what works and what doesn’t, can be useful to the study of this field.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
