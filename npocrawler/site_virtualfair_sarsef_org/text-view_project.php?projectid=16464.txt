For my science project, I would like to acquaint myself with the earth-sun system and gain an understanding of the orbital mechanics that form the basis for the measurement of time and celestial navigation. Based on this knowledge, I will construct an analemmatic sundial calibrated for Tucson, AZ, that gives as accurate a time as possible.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
