Do a Squat, Kick a Ball

My project is about exercise. I add ten squats every day for six days then I kick a ball and measure how far it went. I chose it because I wanted to see how to improve my kicking distance. I wanted to see if squats would help. My conclusion was that my hypothesis was not supported because my numbers decreased quite a bit. It is important because my project is showing us the exercises to do to get better at sports or another exercise.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
