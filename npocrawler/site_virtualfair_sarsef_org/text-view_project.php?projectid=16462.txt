Does Color Affect Taste?
Behavioral and Social Science

Camila Guiverra
Grade:
7

Teacher:
MariAnn Slater

The purpose of my science experiment was to find out whether or not color affects the taste of foods. 

The reason I chose this topic was because I've read so many articles and thought that this was a pretty interesting topic and a while back I was eating a red and blue gummy worm and thought that the blue was blue raspberry but saw that it was actually grape. 

The results were surprising. Most of the tasters guessed different flavors other than vanilla. Only one of the tasters said all the yogurts tasted the same.  

My project is important because it helps people realize that color is way more important than you thought and can really help you when you're picking out food.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
