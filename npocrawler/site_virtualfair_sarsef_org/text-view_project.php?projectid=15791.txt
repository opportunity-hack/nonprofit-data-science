Does the Way Teenagers Feel About Their Body Influence Their Grades?
Behavioral and Social Science

Grade:
HS

Teacher:
Elyse Wexler

My project was about studying if there is a correlation between teenager's body image and their grades/ GPA. I choose this project because body image is a problem for many teenagers and I wanted to see if it could be hindering their school performance. My results/ overall conclusion was that there was no real correlation between low body image and GPA. My project is important because it can show that many teens struggle with body image issues and that they can become a real imposition in their daily lives.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
