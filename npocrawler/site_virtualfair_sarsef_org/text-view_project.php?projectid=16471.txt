Does Color Affect Your Memory?

Does colored wording or black colored wording help you remember better?
I chose this project because I think this experiment will help people with different learning and studying techniques.
The ending results showed that mostly all of my participants remembered the colored wording better rather than the black colored wording. 
My project is important because it can help classes and students with notes, school projects, and tests to help them remember them.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
