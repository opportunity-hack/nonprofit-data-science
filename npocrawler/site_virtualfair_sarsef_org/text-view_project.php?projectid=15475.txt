My project identified the effectiveness of hand sanitizer brands and their effect on bacteria. I chose this project because of the current Covid-19 pandemic, people want to know if hand sanitizers are effective in killing certain bacteria such as Covid-19. My conclusion was that the  Purell hand sanitizer and the hand sanitizer from the body care and home fragrance store Bath and Body works had the least amount of bacteria on the petri dish. making them the winners. What I discovered was that the higher alcohol content in the hand sanitizer the greater the effectiveness of killing germs, viruses and bacteria.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
