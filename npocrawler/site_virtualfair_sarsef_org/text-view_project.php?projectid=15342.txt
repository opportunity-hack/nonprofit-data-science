This project analyzes how vegetation responds to historical changes in rainfall and temperature in Natural Areas surrounding Tucson. I chose this project to further understand how ecosystems like the Sonoran Desert change overtime and how to analyze big data on a real-life topic. The results of this project were that outside factors such as invasive species are impacting healthy vegetation, more rainfall leads to decreases in vegetation, and that the growth of healthy vegetation is constant. This project is important because this project analyzes how historical vegetation data, through GIS satellite imagery, changes and develops in the Tucson community.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
