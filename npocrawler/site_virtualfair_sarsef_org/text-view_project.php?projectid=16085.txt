My project is a chair attachment that is if you hunch over it beeps. I chose this project because I need help sitting straight. My result was that it worked very well and it helps me. My project is important because if you are always hunched over, you will have back problems when you get older.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

What a cool project!!! I really like your idea and design! We all need to have better posture so that we do not suffer from back problems later in life. Great job!
