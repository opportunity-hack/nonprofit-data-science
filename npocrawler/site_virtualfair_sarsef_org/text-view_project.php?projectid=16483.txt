My project was about testing which is the best performing face mask to protect against bacterial particles without raising your temperature (°F) levels. Since the Covid-19 Pandemic occurred, face masks have become a part of our everyday accessories. It is crucial that these accessories are worth wearing. I wanted to test several popular fabrics of face masks to see how beneficial they really are.  In conclusion, Denim face masks were the most effective fabric of face masks (out of the fabrics tested) to wear to keep you cool and protected. Denim face masks collected the least amount of bacteria (only growing 2 small colonies) compared to rayon, twill and polyester and was most effective at keeping you at your base temperature even while working out (only raising temperature by 1.1 °F).  Although cloth grew no visible colonies of bacteria it raised temperature levels by 2.0 °F, a 0.9  °F difference from denim. Rayon was the worst fabric of the mask, collecting the most bacteria and increasing temperature levels by 1.3°F from base.  With face masks becoming a part of our everyday lives, knowing which masks protect and which masks do not is crucial. If everyone wore denim or cloth masks the spread of bacteria could dramatically decrease. With this concrete evidence many people may choose their fabric of face mask more distinctly and use face masks that do their job properly.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
