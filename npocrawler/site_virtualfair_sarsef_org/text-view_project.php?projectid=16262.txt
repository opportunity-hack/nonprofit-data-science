For this project, I wanted to see which whitening would help the most to improve my smile and other’s smiler. There are many products that say they whiten teeth, and this science project will help myself and others decide which product is the best. It will also help people have a whiter smile. Some people get bullied because of the color of their teeth, and this may help them feel more confident and smile at the people who teased them. I have used Crest Teeth Whitening and it made a huge impact on my teeth and that made me feel better about myself.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
