After a holiday project in class we wanted to find out what adhesive is the strongest. We made stars out of popsicle sticks and used different adhesives. Some of them did not hold that well. Then we started talking about what would be the best adhesive if we were going to make a bridge for a toy car, a chair, or even a table. That's when we decided to test to see what adhesive is the strongest out of Elmer's glue, glue stick, wood glue and hot glue. We had to change our project because we ended up going to school virtual.  We got to each do the experiment at our house and record our results.  The Elmer's glue was the strongest to our surprise.  This is good to know when we build ramps and bridges for our toy cars or houses for our stuffy pets.
