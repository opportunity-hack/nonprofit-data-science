The purpose of this research is to determine if in producing more eco-friendly energy, will the
blades on the turbine need to be bigger, and if the blades can be too big, prohibiting them from
working effectively. The reason I chose this project was to learn more about aerodynamics, limits of
wind turbines, and energy. From my findings the larger size of the blades was in fact faster than the
smaller one even though they were quite similar in size. This experiment could be useful in the real
world because more people are needing more energy, and the world needs more energy to power
all the inventions being created.
This project has been cleared by SRC.


Comments

Did you measure the surface area of the blades or just make them bigger?  Quantifying your results would help your project.  This same project could be expanded when you get to high school
