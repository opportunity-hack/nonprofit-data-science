Chemical Science

My project is about the science behind pancakes and how they rises.  I chose this project because I love to bake and it was a great way to show chemical science.  My result was that more gluten in a pancake decreases the height of the pancakes.  My project show how a pancake rises and the science behind it.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
