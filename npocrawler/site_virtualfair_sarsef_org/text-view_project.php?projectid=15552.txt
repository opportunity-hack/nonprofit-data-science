HS-HB014
Electrophysiology Evaluation in Swine of Persistent Atrial Fibrillation
Health and Biomedical Science

Grade:

n/a

1. My project is about the use of a stem-cell cardiomyocyte patch for the treatment of Atrial Fibrillation.
2. I chose this project because I am interested in the heart, and its electrical and contractile properties that govern the cardiovascular system.
3. My conclusions are that multiple swine had completely different outcomes, and that the study needs to be continued to assess the effects of the patch.
4. My project is important because Atrial Fibrillation is the most common cardiac arrhythmia, and it affects more than 1 in 5 people in the Unites States.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
