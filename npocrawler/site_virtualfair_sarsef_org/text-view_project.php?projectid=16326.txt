I tested four different small portable fire starters: Shredded paper, InstaFire, Fritos Corn Chips and petroleum jelly covered cotton balls.  
I was trying to find the best fire starter to carry in a backpack during outdoor activities to start a fire with. I chose this project because I am starting to go backpacking over multiple days and was looking for a fire starter that was light weight and compact and that worked reliably in case I was ever lost or stranded in bad weather.  I found the petroleum jelly covered cotton ball was the most effective fire starter.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
