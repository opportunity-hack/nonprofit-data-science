What Drinks Cause the Most Tooth Decay?

This project delves into what common things we drink that will lead to tooth decay.  I chose this because I wanted to see what drinks I commonly drink were doing to my teeth.  This also gave me a chance to do some research and experimenting.  The result was that acidic drinks cause the most tooth decay.  Lemonade is the worst thing for your teeth.  Gatorade was a close second, due to its high sugar content which is converted to acid by the bacteria in your mouth.  This project is important because it helps people know which drinks to avoid and it may heighten the importance of brushing your teeth more often.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Really a nice job here!
Surprising results - I would have thought Coke would be worse, as well. Great methodology!
