My project is about how different ingredients affect how stretchy the slime is. I chose this because I thought it would be fun. Overall, it was fun and I found that the traditional ingredient, glue, made the slime the most stretchy. It was important because I was able to make a mess and have fun at the same time.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
