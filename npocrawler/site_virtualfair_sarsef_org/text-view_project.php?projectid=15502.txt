How do different materials affect ultraviolet radiation? The purpose of this project is to help people in knowing how they can prevent skin damage from harmful UV rays. This project can also help in future research in topics such as skin cancer and how to prevent it. The experiment ultimately rejected the hypothesis and polyester fabric did the best at blocking UV radiation.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
