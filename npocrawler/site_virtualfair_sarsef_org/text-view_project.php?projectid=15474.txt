Catapulting Experiment

I built three catapults, each with different size arm lengths.  I tested how far a projectile would go when launched to see which arm length would make it travel the farthest.  In conclusion, the catapult with the longest arm sent the projectile the farthest.  This project is interesting and important because it helps us better understand physics and engineering.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
