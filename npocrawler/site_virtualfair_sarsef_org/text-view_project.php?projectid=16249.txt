My project is about finding out what substance was on the irrigation pipes in my backyard. I chose this project because I was curious and interested in this topic. My conclusion was that the substance was calcium carbonate mixed with something that makes it less reactive to acids. My project is important because now we know what is in our water at my house, and what the white stuff is the the bees like so much.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
