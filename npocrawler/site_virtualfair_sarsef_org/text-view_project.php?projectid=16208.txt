The Incredible Three: Super Kittens Fly Again
Animal and Plant Sciences

Grade:

Fred Roberts

This project is about training kittens to identify saliva from a person who has low blood sugar.  A family member is a diabetic and thought that if I could train a kitten not familiar with my family to identify when a person's blood sugar is low, that kitten could be used by any diabetic.  I proved that this is possible and that kittens smell better than dogs when identifying a person with low blood sugar.

Fabulous!
The data is very impressive! You analyzed the data super well and worked very hard! Very good job!
Nice project, good interest, photos and data!
What a great way to help solve a real-world problem. When I saw the title, I thought this would be about teaching cats to fly. But you are teaching those cats to do something so important for your
mom and possibly many other people. I like how you found researchers to interview. Great job!
Frannie - an amazing presentation.  So much research went into this and with three kittens too.  You have a bright future in science.  Keep it up.  Proud of you. Uncle Tony.
My cat used to wake me in the middle of the night when my blood glucose was low.  Great research!
