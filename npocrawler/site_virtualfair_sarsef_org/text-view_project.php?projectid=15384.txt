How Sugary Drinks Affect Our Teeth
Chemical Science

Samuel English, Tyrell Watson
Grade:
8

Teacher:
Joe Beard

We conducted an experiment on how sugary drinks can affect the enamel of our teeth by using an egg to represent our tooth.  We put the eggs into a container which had various drinks containing soda, juice, and Red Bull.  We let the eggs sit for 5 days then calculated the results.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
