About how dogs react to music and when in stressful environment if dogs can calm down by listening to classical or nature sounds. I love animals and I always see stressed dogs, so I wondered if music can help as therapy to dogs. My overall conclusion was correct--dogs do react to music. My project was imortant to me because I have 3 dogs of my own.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Whoa, dogs actually react to music, and now I know that thanks to you! I liked how your dogs reacted to the music either being calm, or playful.
