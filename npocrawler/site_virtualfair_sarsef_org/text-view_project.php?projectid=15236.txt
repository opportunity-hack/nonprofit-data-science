HS-PS001
The Effects of Sodium Polyacrylate on Radishes in Different Soil Ratios
Plant Science

Grade:
HS

Teacher:
Dr. Mary G Lyons

This project tested to see the effects of different rations of sodium polyacrylate on radishes.  This project could help reduce the pollution of sodium polyacrylate on the environment and help with plant water retention.  I chose this project because I am concerned about the environment and reducing pollution of foreign materials in the environment.  Adding sodium polyacrylate does help with plant growth and water retention when added in a 90% soil to 10% sodium polyacrylate ratio.

KEYWORDS:  sodium polyacrylate, plants, radishes, environment, pollution, soil
This project has been cleared by SRC.
