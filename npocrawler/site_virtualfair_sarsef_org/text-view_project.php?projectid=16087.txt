The Floating Pencil
Engineering, Robotics and Computer Sciences

Grade:

Teacher:
Ms. Easterling

My invention will solve the problem of trying to find your pencil when you need to do your schoolwork. Using magnets, the pencil will float in the air, making it easy and fast to grab. More experiments are needed to find the right balance and strength of magnets for the pencil to float in mid-air. With some improvements, the Floating Pencil will help make your school day easier.
