Can I Build a Solar Powered Go Kart?

I was interested in building a solar power go-kart because I race go-karts and I thought it would be fun! During my research, I realized that it would take a lot of power and would be really expensive to do a solar powered go-kart, so I used an RC Car. The solar powered RC Car had to be tested outside because the solar panel needs lots of sunlight to power the battery. I want to add onto this project for next year and build a full size go kart.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
