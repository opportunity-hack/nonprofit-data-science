Can Airplanes Generate Electricity?

This project is about using vertical axis wind turbines along the runways and taxiways of airports to generate electricity using the jet blast which comes from airliner engines. I attempted design a surrounding wall to increase the voltage output of the turbines. I chose this project because it is building on my project last year called "Can Traffic Generate Wind Energy" where the addition of a surrounding wall made the turbines spin faster. My conclusion was that adding surrounding walls did not increase the voltage output on wind turbines places along the an airport runway, but that using turbines along a runway would be successful. My project is important because it is a way to make electricity without using fossils fuels that add greenhouse gases to our atmosphere, causing climate change.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Great creativity and detail in this project.
I love that you continued with your last year project to keep trying new ways to create generation!  great job!  I really enjoyed reading your project.  Keep on the discovery!!
Such a cool project!
Great job!
Really incredible project! Both years were really interesting ideas and designs. I wonder how you imagine the wind turbines might also serve the role of controlling birds? What would that look like?
Nice job Avi keep thinking of ways to help our planet.
