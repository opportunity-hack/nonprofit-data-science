Baking is something I enjoy. My dad is allergic to eggs. I decided to
investigate egg substitutes so we can help people who are allergic to eggs not get sick when they eat baked things.

My experimental problem is, “How will the type of egg substitute affect the quality of the cookies?”

My project will help let people who are allergic to eggs eat my baked
treats like cookies.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
