This project is about the science behind making tempered chocolate and how it goes from piping hot to so cold that it feels like ice. I first got my idea when I was sitting with my mom and she started talking about chocolate then I asked the question “What tempered chocolate type holds its shape better?” I knew that this project was perfect for me because I have a lot of interest in baking and art.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
