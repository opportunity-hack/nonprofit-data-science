The Clash of the Face Masks Science Project demonstrates which common face mask material or materials are most effective in protecting others against COVID-19 and any other viruses. The reason why I selected this science project is because currently we are in a time of crisis, pandemic, and it is vital for society to know which type of common face masks materials will provide them with better protection for them and the people around them.  I have now learned that the best mask material to wear is the double-layered 100 percent cotton, for maintaining and absorbing liquid particles better than the rest of the masks. My project is important because it will inform people what face mask material will give them the best protection during this Coronavirus pandemic.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
