How Effective Is Your Mask??
Health and Wellness

Christian Badinger
Grade:
8

Teacher:
Jessica Maurer

The purpose of this experiment is to figure out which mask material is the best for preventing transmission of something such as a disease?. I became interested in this experiment when school shut down because of COVID-19?. The information gained through this experiment will help protect people by letting them know what type of mask is best when you go out into the public.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
