HS-CB001
Microbial Munching Solution to Pollution: Investigating Core Enzymes Involved in Plastic Biodegradation
Cellular and Molecular Biology

Lilie Mae Gastelum, Mikayla Grech, Adriana Morales
Grade:
HS

Teacher:
Jeremy Jonas

Keywords:
Microbes, microplastics, comparative genomics, biodegradation, sustainability, pollution, microplastics, enyzmes, proteomics

1. Our project is analyzing the similarities found between the genes of polyethylene degrading microbes.
2. We chose this project because we are concerned about the amount of plastics in the oceans and hope to help find a way to decrease the plastic load.
3. Results are pending
4. Our project and findings are important because polyethylene takes a very long time to degrade and even then it is never really gone. These plastics and their micro fragments are destroying environment all over the world. To keep our planet healthy, research into ways to biodegrade these plastics is essential.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Awesome project! i really liked that you were thinking not only of pollution, but how the environment can fight pollution rather than the 3 Rs. great job!
