This is a science project on the creosote resin’s ability to kill the bacteria E. coli. I chose this project because my grandmother uses this native shrub in her tea, but she couldn’t tell me what it actually did, so I decided to start exploring some possible effects. The creosote resin did kill the E. coli and greater concentrations of creosote resin result in larger inhibitions. I now know that the resin kills E. coli, but maybe it can kill other types of bacteria as well and make for a natural cleaner or bacteria treatment.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
