In this experiment we will find out the force of a pull affecting a push. I wanted to find out if I change the thickness of the band in my model, will this affect the distance of the cotton ball I am firing. I found out that the most thin band shot the cotton ball farther than the other launches. I like to engineer things.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Nice job, I'll keep this in mind when I build my own cottonball launcher. And I "wish you a very long, lively, nice life. :)" as well!! ;D
