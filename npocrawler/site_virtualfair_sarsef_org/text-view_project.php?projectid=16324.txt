MariAnn Slater

1.The purpose of my project is to figure out what type of combination of water filtering materials leads to the best drinking water.
2. I chose this project because filtering water is essential for people around the world.
3. The results of this experiment showed that the combination of powdered charcoal and cotton
balls had the lowest and best average ppm of 561.2, in second is the cotton pads and
granulated charcoal with the average ppm of 613, and in third is the granulated charcoal and
powdered charcoal with an average ppm of 675.4. All of these increased from the original
PPM of 400.
4. My project is important because it helps me know what type of filtration is needed for the lowest contaminants.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
