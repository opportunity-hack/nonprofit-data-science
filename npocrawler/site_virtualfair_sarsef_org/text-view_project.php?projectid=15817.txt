Behavioral and Social Sciences

Mabel Rivera Class
Grade:
3

Teacher:
Mabel Rivera

We did a social and behavioral experiment about the best communication tool to
keep our partners safe, while still allowing them to take over their partners project
successfully. Since we have to be flexible and able to work socially distantly, we needed a
way to continue our computer science work. We needed to modify the behaviors and
instructions we were used to using in order to complete the project, but our partner’s safety
was worth the effort.
This project has been cleared by SRC.


Comments

Great research!
This is a really cool idea - people communicate very differently and it has probably changed since this pandemic has started, so this is really important!
