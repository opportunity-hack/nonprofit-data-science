Grade:
8

Teacher:
MariAnn Slater

What is your project about?

My project is about bacterial growth on cosmetic tools.

Why did you choose this topic?

I chose this topic because makeup  and skincare are things that I am very passionate about and I view makeup as an art form where you can portray many things and tell many different stories.   

What was the result/conclusion?

The results of this experiment showed that the mascara grew an average of 8.6 bacterial    colonies.  The lip gloss grew an average of 11, bacterial colonies, concealer grew an average of 14 bacterial colonies, and The beauty blender had the most bacterial colony growth with an average of 37 bacterial colonies..

Why is your project important ?
This experiment is important because it was able to help me determine which cosmetic tool collectected the most bacteria and how much bacteria grew on other cosmetic products encouraging better upkeep of makeup tools.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
