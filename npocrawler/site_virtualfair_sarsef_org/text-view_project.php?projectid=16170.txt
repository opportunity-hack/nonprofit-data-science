My project is playing 15 ping-pong games with my dad, analyzing those games and playing with him again to see if I could beat him. I chose this project because I love the game, but my dad just kept beating me and I had to do something about that. My overall project conclusion was that yes, I was able to beat my dad when I had the knowledge of his weaknesses by 9-6 where as previously I had lost to him 5-10. My project is important because it shows how analyzing something can help people improve. Analyzing data could also help me in the future knowing what to look at and where to get started. 
Keywords:  Ping-pong, Analytics, Dad, Winner
This project has been cleared by SRC.

You were very dedicated to watch all that video! I hope you will get to learn more about analytics, as it is a very popular field right now.
