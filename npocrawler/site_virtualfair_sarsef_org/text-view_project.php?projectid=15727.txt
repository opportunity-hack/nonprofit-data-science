The Package Problem

At our house we have a very long driveway that goes up a hill. A lot of times the delivery drivers can’t get up the hill to deliver packages. Sometimes the drivers have to walk all the way up the hill with a heavy package. I interviewed a delivery driver to find out what was most helpful to them and if they were allowed to deliver in boxes.  
I am making a sheltered box for packages for the delivery people to use to solve the problem. I will collect data on how often the box is used after it is made. I will see how I can improve my design.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Great project! You chose a real question that you had to answer and got great results. Very well done.
This is an amazing project. It is a creative way to solve a problem for delivery drivers and will increase their productivity by decreasing the delivery time at each stop.
Great project. Your presentation looked good, was well written and organized and the box looked well designed and built. Good luck.
I like the research you did before you conducted the practical part of your research.
What a useful and interesting project! Great job interviewing the delivery driver as part of your project. Overall, job well done. Your hard work was evident in this project!
