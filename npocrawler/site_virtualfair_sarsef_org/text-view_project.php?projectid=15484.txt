My project is about the affect the presence of parabens (polypropyl and sodium benzoate in commercial baby wipes) has on a baby wipe's biodegradability compared to one without preservatives. I chose this project because personal care wipes are a staple in many individual's daily routine, but most contain preservatives that could be harmful not only to the individual themselves, but also the environment. Do the preservatives prevent the wipes from decomposing in landfills, water, recycle where they are disposed? The weight of the biodegradable wipe remained at 0.04oz except for commercial wipe two, which increased to 0.07oz. This shows that there was no difference in the wipes' biodegradability, which could have been because the period underground (4 weeks) was too short for microbes or water in the soil to decompose the wipes. My project is important because it could encourage individuals to stop their use of commercial baby wipes due to the possible effects they have on the environment and humans.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
