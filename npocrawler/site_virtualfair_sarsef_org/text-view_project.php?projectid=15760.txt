HS-BE021
Correlation of College Enrollment to College Prices
Behavioral and Social Science

Grade:
HS

Elyse Wexler

My project has to deal with statistics and about finding a correlation of college enrollment to college prices. I chose to do this because, being in high school the next big steps in life are going to college for most students. Finding out about college prices and the number of students could help me figure out if some students are discouraged to go to college due to student debt. My results were that both of my variables gradually increased.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Very relevant topic.  I wonder why the price of education has skyrocketed?
This is a super interesting and prevalent issue! Great work.
