I am a sixth grader who goes to a school called Borman Astros elementary school K 8 in Tucson, Arizona. When I was born, I had poor depth perception on my left eye. My mom and dad tried to get me to patch for about three hours and repeat that every single day to get my brain to focus on my left more than my right. However, for three weeks It was still the same.

I am doing this Science experiment because I'm trying to help my left eye out. My mom and dad asked me if I keep on lifting my patch to see out of my right eye. I'll be honest, I have. I'm trying so hard to stop cheating but it just never works because it's so unclear out of my left eye. So, for three weeks straight, I wondered to myself "Can patching for two or more months increase my eye sight?"
This project has been cleared by SRC.
