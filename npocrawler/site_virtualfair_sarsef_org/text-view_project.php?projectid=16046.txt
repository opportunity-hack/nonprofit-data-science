My project compared different additions to soil to see which one made plants grow the tallest. I chose this project because it is interesting to me to see how plants grow with different nutrients in the soil. The result was that the soil with compost helped the radish plants to grow the tallest. My project is important because it explores options for improving plant growth. This is important for agriculture, which is the majority of our economy in Yuma, where I live.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Wow, I'm surprised, I've been saving all my coffee grounds for my plants.  I don't think I really need to be anymore. Thanks for the valuable information!
