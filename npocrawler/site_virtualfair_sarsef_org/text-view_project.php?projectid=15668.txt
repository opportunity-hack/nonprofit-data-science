The 5-Second Rule -- Is it Legit?
Health and Wellness

Grade:
5

Teacher:
Mrs. Yewell

The phenomenon that my project explored was that if the 5 second rule applicable in the real world? Does more bacteria grow depending on how long the foods were on the floor? Does the texture of the food affect the bacteria collection? I chose this project because I was wondering if the 5 second rule was accurate. Overall, I think I don’t think the 5-second rule is legit based on what I observed. Factors that could have influenced this include where the samples were placed on the ground. This project is important because there are times when people eat their food off of the ground and knowing that it may make you sick could make a difference if you eat it or not.

I really like that you looked at both the total number of colonies and the different types of colonies!
This was a great project.  I liked how you came to your conclusion and the test you ran to prove it.  Good job!
