We are in the middle of a FOSS sound and light unit. Kids built string cup telephones using materials they have at home and then tested them out. Afterwards kids shared their results.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Weird how people invented these. Nice Experiment to finding out whether these worked or not! Great Job!
