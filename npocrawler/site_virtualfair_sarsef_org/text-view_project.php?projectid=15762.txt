This project was about how to best clean our hands. We chose this project because we are being asked to clean our hands a lot lately and are curious about which method is the most effective. Overall, we found that washing our hands using soap and water was the best method for cleaning  our hands and getting rid of bacteria. This project is important because it helps us better understand bacteria and the importance of washing our hands.
This project has been cleared by SRC.


Comments

Good hand washing is important. A control of a hand swab with no washing would also be interesting to see and compare. Good job!
Unfortunate that it may have been contaminated, but still a well done project. Having good procedures like this will spell success in the future. Great work!
Great job! Your project has very important health measures, by washing your hands constantly because if all the bacteria and viruses.
