How well does a seed grow when sunlight is filtered through a color?We had just finished learning about structures of a plant and what it needs to grow.  We wondered what makes a plant NOT grow besides the obvious, like over watering, or not watering...
Different groups of students got different results.  Many plants died due to neglect as they were grown over a break, however it was about 50-50 as to whether or not plants can grow through a colored filter. Knowing the conditions that plants can successfully grow in is useful for farmers and other agricultural groups.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Great experiment on plants! I enjoyed reading your interpretation and data! Good job
Interesting that the humidity seems to be a contributing factor in helping certain plants grow. Good work coming up with that result!
