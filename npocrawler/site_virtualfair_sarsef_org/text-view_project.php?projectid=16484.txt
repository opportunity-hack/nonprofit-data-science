My project is about testing if a wingspan on a rocket affects the flight distance. Why did I choose this project is because I found this topic interesting and I also want to become an engineer in the future. The rocket with the second biggest wings flew the farthest. The reason why this experiment is important is because people can use this information to build a bottle rocket that can fly further.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
