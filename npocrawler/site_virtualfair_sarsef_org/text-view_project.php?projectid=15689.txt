A conversation and creative collaboration on environmental change in Southeast Tucson. An ecological awareness project incorporating art and humanities to raise awareness of ecological grief due to global warming in our local ecosystem, the Sonoran Desert. It is important to provide opportunities for conversation and understanding of how global warming is affecting people.
This project has been cleared by SRC.


Comments

I love how you included the community and focused on the conversations.  Tough to document this type of research but so important, well done. (and the color changing paint is such a fun idea!!)
I found this project to be very thorough
I was so impressed with your integration of art! Such an important vehicle for the communication of ideas - especially related to environmental change here in Tucson.
