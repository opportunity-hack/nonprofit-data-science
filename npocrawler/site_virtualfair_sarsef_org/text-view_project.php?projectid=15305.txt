HS-EL001
How to Use Manipulating Magnets to Improve Generator Output
Electrical and Mechanical Engineering

William Wang
Grade:
HS

Teacher:
Dr. Mary G Lyons

This is an engineering project about how to use manipulating magnets to improve generator output.  I chose this project because I think it is interesting.  My overall conclusion is that the number of coil turns and the magnitude of the voltage in the generator are proportional at a 7:2 ration.  The project is important because increasing the generator output can better convert other energy into usable energy.

KEYWORDS:  engineering, generator output, magnets, coils, voltage, energy.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
