Using Fruits and Vegetables for Sustainable Electricity

My project is about which fruits and vegetables make the most electricity. I chose this project because we need to find sustainable ways to create electricity. My conclusion is that fruits and vegetables with high acidity in a circuit can generate electricity. My project is important because sustainable electricity can save our PLANET!
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Wow! Your conclusion has precisely matched with the data that you gave! Nice go at the experiment!
This is so exciting! Your charts are very clear. Thank you.
What a crazy experiment! I like all of the ideas used to create this project! Well Done!
What a great idea for a project! I work at TEP and I didn't know that fruit could generate that much energy. Maybe that's something we should consider. I like your creativity.
