My project is about how video games affect your sleep.  I chose this project because many kids play video games and they also need their sleep.  My results showed me that playing video games before bed makes it harder to fall asleep.  My project is important because lots of kids play video games before bed so then it takes them longer to fall asleep and then they have less energy.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Great analyzation on the behavioral aspect on how video games affect the mental health of people! I liked the tools used here
This is the best one yet
Great project! This is a very important topic. Your project has great details and information.
Awesome job! Your project has information of the health of humans, and something that has been affecting the world the last years.
This is very interesting. My mom is always telling me to get off my devices 1 hour before bed and now I know why.
