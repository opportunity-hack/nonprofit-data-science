This experiment is to make biodiesel from new vegetable oil and new olive oil. Once the Biodiesel is made, then it will be ran in a diesel motor and be tested to see if petroleum based diesel, olive oil biodiesel, or vegetable biodiesel is more efficient in a diesel engine and have lower co or co2 levels.  The results of the experiment were that the co and co2 levels were lower with the biodiesel than they were with regular diesel.  This experiment will help others know that it is better for our environment to use biodiesel than regular diesel.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
