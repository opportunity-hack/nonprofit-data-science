HS-EN009
Making a Saguaro H.A.W.T.
Energy and Environmental Engineering

The purpose of this experiment was to use biomimicry to design and build a wind turbine tower which utilizes the structure of a saguaro cactus and test the aerodynamic efficiency and load bearing capacity of this tower against a conventional tubular tower. I chose this project because I am passionate about environmental issues, and I believe that science should look to nature for inspiration in solving problem. I concluded that a wind turbine tower designed with the pleats and spines of a saguaro cactus would better utilize winds, especially at lower wind speeds, to produce more electricity. This is an important step to maximizing wind power as a source of energy to be dependently used in a future without fossil fuels.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
