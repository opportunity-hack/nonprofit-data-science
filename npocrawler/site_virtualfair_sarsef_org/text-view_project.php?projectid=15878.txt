What is your project about?
My project tested the effectiveness of using ultraviolet light to kill bacteria on household surfaces. This experiment helped me figure out if there are alternatives to chemical cleaners.



Why did you choose this project?
I chose this project because my parents were worried about cleaning our house at the start of the Coronavirus pandemic, and many cleaners were sold out at the stores.  We needed to find a different way to clean.


What was your result/overall conclusion?
Overall, my project proved that an 18 watt handheld UV light can effectively kill bacteria on all household surfaces (as much as 99% in my experiment).


Why is your project important?
This project is important because it provides reassurance that chemical cleaners are not the only way to clean.  This is good information when disinfectants are not available to purchase or if people have sensitivities to chemical cleaners.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
