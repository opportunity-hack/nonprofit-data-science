Do Hummingbirds Have A Color Preference?

My project is about if hummingbirds have a preference of their color food. I chose to do this because whenever I looked up a hummingbird recipe, it would always say to not use red dye but it never had an explanation. I wanted to test this and see if they preferred red sugar water rather than normal. In the end, the hummingbirds preferred the normal sugar water rather that the red. This is important because now I know red sugar water attracts other birds like sparrows, finches, and woodpeckers but does not attract more hummingbirds.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
