What is your project about?
What color light can you read fastest in?



Why did you choose this project?
I chose this project because I like reading in dim light, so I wanted to see what kind of light you could read fastest in. 


What was your result/overall conclusion?
My overall conclusion for the fastest reading light is the white light at 38.99 seconds, and the red light was the slowest reading time at 60.65 seconds.  


Why is your project important?
This project is important because if you need to read something but only have a short amount of time to do so, or if you want to enjoy your reading material, you know what light to read in.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
