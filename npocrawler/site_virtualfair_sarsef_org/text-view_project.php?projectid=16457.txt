The Difference in Expression of Color Pigmentation Based on Gender
Behavioral and Social Science

My project is about comparing the way we see with the way colors are created on a computer screen.  I became interested in the way we see color in my chemistry class, and decided I wanted to do a project.  My conclusion is that there was no apparent difference in how we see color based on gender.  This project is important to help us better understand the way we see color, the way we create color, and how our eyes function.
