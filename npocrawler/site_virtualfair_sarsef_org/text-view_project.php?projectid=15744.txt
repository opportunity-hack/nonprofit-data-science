This experiment showed how my lunch diet affects my mood and well being while taking the Attention-Deficit Disorder medication Vyvanse. Three lunch categories: High Protein, High Carb, and High Sugar were tested. A mood score and how I feel score (from my perspective and my dad’s perspective) was recorded after school each day for 18 days. The results showed that a high protein lunch diet resulted in the highest mood and how I feel scores.
This project has been cleared by SRC.


Comments

Great and original question with real-world implications!
Each of us are living experiments and we can use the scientific process for learning what makes us feel our best. Well done!
I admire how you examined a question/problem that is relevant and important to your life. The data is truly useful to you.
