Which cleaners kill germs the best.  I thought it would be fun to test out different cleaners against germs.  Clorox wipes did the best at killing germs and baby wipes did the worst.  It helps people know which one is more effective.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Nice conclusion.  I'll be sure to put Clorox Wipes on my shopping list!!  Good job!
Good find! It's important for people to know that this is actually an important element to stay healthy! Great Project!
