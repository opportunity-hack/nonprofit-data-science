The Effect of Violent Video Games on Student Opinion on Guns
Behavioral and Social Science

Leo T Klump
Grade:
HS

Teacher:
Elyse Wexler

My project is about video games and guns. I chose this project because I like video games, and I thought it would be interesting to see if they affected people’s opinion on guns. I found a strong correlation between the number of violent video games owned and political beliefs. In addition, violent video game ownership correlates slightly with gun control views. This research helped determine if there is any correlation between video games and political views, especially gun control.
This project has been cleared by SRC.


Comments

Violent videos games do have an impact on people's consciousness, so this research project is relevant to today's society.
This is such an important topic!  Thank you for studying this.  Mrs. Wexler
