Abstract: My backyard wall was taken out by a car (This had happened before) This concerned me so I decided to do something about it. Our family called the city of Marana and they put in cement wheel stops. When I saw the wheel stops I didn’t think they would work. I created a simulation using legos and remote control cars to test my theory. The wheel stops ended up having a small effect on the damage to the wall, however the damage could possibly still injure a person.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Your project was "Wheely, Wheely" great! I am so impressed that you took a real, personal problem and designed an experiment to test. Such an awesome job!
