HS-RC001
Robotic Exploration: Discovering the Effects of Arduino Coding in Engineering Products
Robotics and Computer Science

1) Our project is about exploring robotic functions with different designs to their model to be able to see what the differences will be for a robot with coding and no coding.
2) We chose this project because we both want to become engineers in the future, and this will help us get a head start in the engineering field. 
3) The Arduino based robot with code was more successful than the Robot with no code. Even though both robots were able to complete the same tasks, the robot with code was most efficient. 
4) This project is important because we want to become engineers, it will give us an insight as to what we will be working on in the near future and be able to make an impact on our community while discovering the affects of coding on engineering products.
Keywords: Arduino, Robotics, Circuit, Motor, Code, Electronics, Engineering, Computer Science.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
