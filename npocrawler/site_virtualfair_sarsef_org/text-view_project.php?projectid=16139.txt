You Are What You Eat! Prediction of Food Allergy Development

"You Are What You Eat!" focuses on trying to find the predictability of food allergy development based off of ethnicity. I chose this project because I myself have food allergies, and this project is a continuation of my project from last year which asked how the mother's eating habits affects the food allergy development in her children; to summarize I am trying to get a better understanding of the true causes of food allergies. My results proved my hypothesis that food allergies are influenced by one's ethnicity, because my graphs showed that Caucasians were more prone to developing general food allergies than Hispanics/Latinos, and of the Caucasians who had food allergies, over half of them had a nut allergy (peanuts, tree nuts, other nuts). Overall, the results from this project can help doctors and scientists who are using their collected research to try to find possible preventions for food allergies and even cures for food allergies in the future, as well as spread awareness to the general public about the seriousness of food allergies, especially in the United States where food allergies in children is constantly growing into an epidemic. 
Key Words: allergy, ethnicity, food allergies, health, medicine, epidemic
This project has been cleared by SRC.
