Lemon Battery Power vs. Potato Battery Power

My project is about creating power with lemon and potato batteries.  I wanted to know if it was even possible for lemons and potatoes to make power.  Both potatoes and lemons made power but potatoes made a little bit more.  This experiment could give someone the information they need to make a light if they were stranded somewhere without batteries, but had the right materials.  It also might make people think about other ways we could make and use electricity everyday.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

Great work!  You learned that electricity is generated in unexpected ways!  You measured results carefully and proved your hypothesis about potatoes!  Do you think
that sweet potatoes would work?
Good project! You put a lot of effort into this! Nice Work!
