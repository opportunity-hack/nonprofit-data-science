HS-CM008
The Struggle with  Biofuels
Chemical and Material Science

Enrique Gutierrez Meza
Grade:
HS

Teacher:
Marelis Vazquez Rivera

This project is about finding alternative sources of glucose to create ethanol. This ethanol could later be used, in theory, to create biofuels. I chose this project because of the controversy that exists on whether or not biofuels are a good option. My results proved that the temperature of the water used in the process of yeast fermentation affects how much carbon dioxide is released. My project is important because it shows how different the outcome of an experiment can be if we change a small thing  that most people would see as unimportant.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
