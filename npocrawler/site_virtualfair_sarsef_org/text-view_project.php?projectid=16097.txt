Natural vs. Synthetic: Which Cleaner Is Most Effective in Removing Bacteria?

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the need for effective cleaners has recently increased.  The objective of this study is to determine which out of these four cleaners (On Guard Sanitizing mist, Clorox wipes, a vinegar and water mixed solution, or the Norwex Enviro cloth) is the most effective in killing typical surface bacteria. Four surfaces were individually swabbed before and
after being treated with each of the cleaners above. These swabs were then immediately transferred to separate Petri dishes, which were pre-treated with Agar. After approximately six days under a heating lamp, all eight petri dishes were removed and the bacterial growth between the dish containing the swab before the cleaner and the dish containing the swab after the cleaner was measured. Surprisingly, this study suggests that the vinegar and water mix killed the most bacteria and the Clorox wipes killed the least.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
