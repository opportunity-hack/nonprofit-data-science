This project is about testing the stretchiness of different slime recipes. We chose this project because slime is so cool. We found that of the 4 recipes we tested the one that used 1 tablespoon of contact solution as the activator made the stretchiest slime. We learned about measurement and how to make something using a recipe, these are important skills for lots of things.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
