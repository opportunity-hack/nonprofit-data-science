Plant watering is a big task that needs to be remembered every day. Sometimes we do not have time to water our plants, so we created a self-watering plant system out of materials from our home. After several prototypes and designs our final prototype was a success. This project is important because plants are vital to our health and water use needs to be monitored.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
