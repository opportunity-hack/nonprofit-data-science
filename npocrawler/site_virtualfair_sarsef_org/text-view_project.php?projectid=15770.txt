My project was comparing several different of disinfectants to determine which one kills the most germs/bacteria. I chose this project because since COVID people want to stop the spread of the virus and stay healthy. The findings of my study found that bleach kills the most germs/bacteria. This is important information because it can help people choose the best disinfectant/cleaner  to reduce the spread of  germs and stay healthy.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
