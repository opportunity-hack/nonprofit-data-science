My project was to find out "What brand of hand soap kills the most bacteria on the hands?" I chose this project because it to see what brand of hand soap works best in order to kill bacteria on the hands of family and friends. My overall result was that Equate Antibacterial Liquid hand soap and Dial bar hand soap kills the most bacteria. This project was important because I was able to find out what hand soap kills the most bacteria on the hands. I tested it using a product called Glo-Germ.
