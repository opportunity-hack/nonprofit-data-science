The Power of pH
Plant Science

Nainika Menakuru, Elizabeth R. Smith
Grade:
HS

Teacher:
Michael Frank, PhD

The project, “Power of pH”, elaborates on the effect pH has on photosynthetic rate. “Power of pH” was chosen to experiment and find out which environment, either acidic, neutral, or basic is best suited for photosynthesis, or plant growth. After multiple trials, it was concluded that a basic solution produced the greatest photosynthetic rate and is best to stimulate plant growth. This conclusion can be utilized to determine the best environmental components for future plant growth.
This project has been cleared by SRC.
