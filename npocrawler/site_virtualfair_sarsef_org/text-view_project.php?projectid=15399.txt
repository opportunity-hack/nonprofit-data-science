My project is about the ways that smells and baits affect fish behavior. I choose this project cause I have a passion for animals, and the outdoors. I love fishing and doing things outside with my family, so I felt it was the best project for me. I found out that fish preferred the greasy look, and the smell of the Slim Jim, and they also did not want to leave the protection of their shelter. My project is important because it helps to understand they ways that fish react, and to find out what works best to catch fish, when in a survival situation.
This project has been cleared by SRC.

I like how you did research that you are interested in and had a practical application for. I hope you do get to continue testing in different places with different fish.
I really learned something. I often fish for bluegills and never thought to use a Slim Jim for bait. Looks like it does well, inexpensive, and stores better than worms. Thanks for the tip
Congratulations on your successful project. Good job!
What a great idea to research the science behind fishing! Fishing is not only a hobby, but also a competitive sport, a livelihood, and a way of life for many people around the world!
