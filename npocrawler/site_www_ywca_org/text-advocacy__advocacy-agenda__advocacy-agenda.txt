ADVOCACY AGENDA
YWCA carries on its long tradition of social action and advocacy to advance our mission  – and you are a crucial part of this work. Your voice is critical as we advocate for policies that bring us closer to eliminating racism, empowering women, and ensuring peace, justice, freedom and dignity for all.
Learn more about our policy and advocacy agenda below. Visit our Action Center to join us in taking action on our 2021-2022 legislative priorities.

Mental, behavioral, and emotional health

Racial Justice
more




Eliminate policies and practices that criminalize people of color
YWCA is committed to ensuring that everyone is afforded equal opportunity and equal protection under the law. Too often, however, stereotypes, biases, and racial power dynamics are embedded in our laws and public policies. They are also reflected in the use of racial profiling, heightened surveillance tactics, targeted enforcement strategies, and other practices that increase policing of certain racial and ethnic communities (but not others) and criminalize people of color.
What we support:

Ending racial and religious profiling
Creating safe, equitable educational environments that support learning for all students, especially those most impacted by school discipline and sexual harassment policies and practices
Reforming laws, policies, and practices to safeguard people of color from police violence
Passing laws, resolutions, and ordinances that declare racism to be a public health crisis

Women’s Economic Security
more




Expand opportunities for women’s successful workplace participation
Equal pay, workplace fairness, and access to high-skill and high-wage jobs are essential to women’s economic advancement in the 21st century. As breadwinners, caretakers, and essential drivers of our nation’s economy, women should not have to choose between their livelihood and their health, their family, or their safety. Yet far too many women and families, particularly women and families of color, must make this choice every day.
What we support:

Fair wages and equal pay
Safe, fair, and inclusive workplaces free of discrimination and harassment
Paid family leave, paid sick leave, and job-protected safe leave
Access to training, career development, and educational opportunities in high-skilled, high wage, STEM, and other 21st century work opportunities







Child Care
more




Increase access to quality, affordable childcare and early education programs
Child care and early learning programs are essential for working women and for our nation’s economic future. The COVID-19 pandemic escalated already-existing barriers to women’s economic participation, inequities for women and families of color, and the capacity challenges that have plagued childcare providers for generations. Our nation’s post-COVID recovery requires that we build an equitable, sustainable childcare infrastructure that meets the needs of all women, families, and childcare providers.
What we support:

Quality, affordable childcare and early education programs
Strengthening early learning access for low-income families, including HeadStart, Early HeadStart, and CCDBG
Training, professional development, and living wages / improved compensation for child care workforce
Funding and support to safely reopen and expand childcare services impacted by the COVID-19 crisis







Safety from Gender-Based Violence
more




Prevent Gender-Based Violence and Support Survivors
Women and girls of all ages, income levels, racial and ethnic communities, sexual orientations, gender identities, and religious affiliations continue to experience violence in the form of domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence, stalking, and trafficking. As the largest network of domestic and sexual violence service providers in the United States, YWCA works for practical solutions to protect survivors, hold perpetrators accountable, and eradicate all forms of gender-based violence.
What we support:

Reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA)
Reauthorization of the Family Violence Prevention and Services Reauthorization Act (FVPSA)
Preserve and increase the cap on the Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) fund
Common-sense solutions that decrease the threat of domestic violence gun homicide
Job-protected safe leave to enable survivors to seek medical and legal support
Safe, inclusive school environments that are free from sexual violence, are supportive of survivors, and that respect and affirm gender identity and expression

Federal Budget / Appropriations
more




Increase Federal Support for Nonprofit Services and Programs
YWCA is on the front lines of communities, strengthening the pillars of economic security for women and families and meeting their needs in moments of crisis. Every day, we see first-hand the critical difference that federal funding for housing, childcare, domestic violence, workforce development, and other services makes in communities served by YWCAs.
What we support:

Full funding for the Family Violence Prevention & Services Act (FVPSA) and for the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA)
Transitional housing, Continuum of Care, and Emergency Solutions Grants
Increasing federal funding for child care, workforce training and development, and STEM careers
Programs like SNAP, WIC, LIHEAP that help families meet basic human needs when economic challenges arise
Emergency support for nonprofits during public health crises and natural disasters

Strengthening the Nonprofit Sector
more




Strengthen the health and vitality of the YWCA network
YWCA is a national leader along with other charitable partners in supporting policies that contribute to a strong civic society and culture of giving so that we can better serve women, girls, and their families. We support policies such as tax incentives that promote charitable giving and efforts to strengthen our democratic society.
What we support:

Emergency support for nonprofits during public health crises and natural disasters
Protection of the Johnson Amendment, which maintains nonpartisanship among nonprofit organizations
Incentivizing charitable giving
Including nonprofit sector services as an essential component of national infrastructure policy

Civil Rights
more




Protect the Rights and Safety of Marginalized Communities
YWCA’s intersectional mission to eliminate racism and empower women demands that we show up to advocate against the oppression that historically marginalized groups and individuals endure. We recognize the interconnected experiences of discrimination and disadvantage that women face from their overlapping identities.
What we support:

A full, fair, and transparent census and redistricting process
Restoration of the full protections of the Voting Rights Act of 1965
Legal protections for LGTBQ+ people
Equal Rights Amendment

Health Care
more




Ensure health care for women, girls, and marginalized people
Quality, affordable, culturally-competent health care is critical to everyone. But for many women, children, people of color, and trauma survivors, getting the medical care and insurance coverage they need is a struggle. Moreover, unequal access to health care is a driving factor in racial disparities in maternal and other health outcomes in the U.S.
What we support:

Protecting and expanding healthcare coverage for women
Trauma-informed care
Comprehensive reproductive health services
Improved maternal health outcomes for women of color
Elimination of health disparities
Addressing racism as a public health crisis

 






Immigration
more




Protect Immigrant Women, Children, and Families
YWCA is committed to ensuring that those seeking safety and opportunity in the U.S. can arrive and live without fear, harm, or discrimination. Current immigration policies, however, have retraumatized survivors of violence, heightened fears, and exacerbated discrimination against immigrant communities. Any discussion of immigration must prioritize the safety of immigrant women, children, and families who often have experienced violence, trafficking, extreme poverty, and other threats to their safety and health.
What we support:

A path to citizenship for undocumented individuals brought to the U.S. as children
An end to family separation and family detention
Asylum for survivors of violence
Full and fair immigration and asylum proceedings
