National Clearinghouse of Research and Data
In an effort to showcase key data and research that supports our mission, YWCA would like to highlight partner organizations, external stakeholders, and academic institutions that help to advance our vision.  The National Data Clearinghouse is a comprehensive list of research reports, surveys, case studies, and policy recommendations that are aligned with improving the key areas of our mission: Racial Justice and Civil Rights, Empowerment and Economic Advancement, and Health and Safety.  
At YWCA USA, we pride ourselves on providing interdisciplinary programs and services to support women at every stage of life. We understand that, to advance this work, effective data collection from various fields is vital to the operational excellence of YWCA USA as well as our 200+ local associations across the country.  
The following list of data sources below is a continuous project and will be updated on a bi-annual basis.  If you would like to submit your data/research findings to the National Data Clearinghouse,  please email: clowry@ywca.org
