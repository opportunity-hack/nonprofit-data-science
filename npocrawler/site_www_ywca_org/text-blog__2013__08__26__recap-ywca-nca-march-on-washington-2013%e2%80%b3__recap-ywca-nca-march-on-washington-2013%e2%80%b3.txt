Recap – YWCA NCA “March on Washington 2013?
August 26, 2013

by YWCA National Capital Area
Saturday, August 24th was truly an event to remember…

50 years ago Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. led thousands of supporters in Washington DC in a march that allowed him to give one of the most historic speeches to date… “I Have A Dream.” This speech was a direct call to end racism, injustice and unemployment.

Since 1905 the YWCA National Capital Area has always been at the forefront of advocating for not just women’s rights but for rights of all mankind. Women have been treated as second class for far too long and we are committed to making sure that our voices are heard!

Saturday’s march commemorated the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington in 1963. Thousands of people from all over the nation attended and heard from special guest speakers including: Martin Luther King III, Nancy Pelosi, Rev. Al Sharpton, Jesse Jackson, Asean Johnson (youngest motivational speaker at the march), Sybrina Fulton (Trayvon Martin’s mother), Attorney General Eric Holder, Rev. Bernice King and Myrlie Evers-Williams. Everyone gave great speeches and reinforced the purpose of this movement.
