Purpose
Welcome to the YWCA Map: A National Footprint of Women’s Empowerment! This interactive map is a new online tool that showcases the local, state, and regional impact of over 200 YWCAs across the country.
In an effort to better educate various stakeholders, government officials, and local community members about our work, YWCA USA aims to create a comprehensive solution that highlights our community investments in racial justice, economic advancement, and health and safety. Our goal is to use this interactive map, which is backed by data and research, as an ongoing collaboration tool to evaluate existing policies that impact women, girls, and families. It will also serve as a foundation for future policy and program assessments as we strive to support effective policy recommendations that are aligned with YWCA’s overall mission of eliminating racism and empowering women.
Methodology
The interactive web map displays a variety of data points from both internal YWCA and external data sources. Below, you will find information on how each data point was sourced.

# of unregistered and registered women voters
TargetSmart Communications, LLC
TargetSmart’s National VoterBase File consists of data from statewide voter registration files from the 50 states, plus Washington, DC, along with Unregistered Voting Age Person (VAP) records that are acquired from national consumer marketing files. The Unregistered VAP records are consumer occupancy records that are not found on TargetSmart’s current state voter registration files.
The Unregistered VAP records are multi-sourced by various proprietary data compilation methods. A consumer occupancy will appear in the compilation process via events that establish a “commercial footprint” such as — but not limited to — owning a mortgage, having a landline phone contract, or third-party sharing of online purchases/surveys/warranties. Through this multi-sourcing process, a consumer occupancy will be validated, meaning that more than one source is needed to confirm the occupancy.
