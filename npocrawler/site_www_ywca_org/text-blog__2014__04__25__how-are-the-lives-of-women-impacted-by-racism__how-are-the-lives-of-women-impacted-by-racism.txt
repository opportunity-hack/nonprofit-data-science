How are the lives of women impacted by racism?
April 25, 2014

Tags: housing, jobs, pay equality, racism, safety, Stand Against Racism, women 



By Michele Davis
Director of Community and Social Justice Initiatives,
YWCA of Brooklyn
Women must fight daily for pay equality,  safety at home and on the streets, and the right to not be victimized by “systems” that do not always value women.
Racism adds an additional fight for women. Racism creates barriers to housing, jobs, promotions, and other quality of life essentials.
Without the opportunity to have basic needs met and to have a quality life, women cannot succeed in supporting themselves and/or raising their children with adequate resources.
Additionally, women are faced with added stress, which results in increased anxiety and health issues.
The YWCA of Brooklyn will continue to Stand Against Racism and fight for the equality every human being deserves.

not afraid to say how they believe. All the time go after your heart.

The other day, while I was at work, my cousin stole
my iPad and tested to see if it can survive a 25 foot drop, just so she can be
a youtube sensation. My apple ipad is now broken and she has 83 views.
I know this is entirely off topic but I had to share it with
someone!
