Join the YWCA USA’s Stand Against Racism 2013 Blog Carnival!
April 5, 2013

Tags: blog carnival, civil rights, community, dialogue, events, racial justice, Stand Against Racism, ywca 



by Katie Stanton 
 YWCA USA Social Media Manager
Each year, the YWCA hosts Stand Against Racism –  an annual event that aims to raise awareness about racism and to increase the dialogue about racial justice and diversity in local communities across the United States. Racial justice is an integral and defining part of the work of the YWCA. Stand Against Racism is a signature event that furthers our mission to eliminate racism and empower women across the country.
This year, the YWCA USA is hosting a blog carnival that will answer the question:
“What will it take to create a community that is free of racism in all forms?”

We want to hear your voices! We encourage you to write a blog post telling us what you think it will take to eliminate racism in the United States. What are the biggest challenges? What still needs to be done? How have you been involved with civil rights in your community? Check out last year’s blog carnival for inspiration. (Don’t know what a blog carnival is? Click here.) 
The YWCA USA will collect the blog posts and publish them throughout the day on Friday, April 26, the official day to take a Stand Against Racism. We will share the posts on Twitter all day using the hashtag #standagainstracism, and we welcome you to share on Twitter, too!
How to Submit Your Post:
Please email your submission to kstanton@ywca.org by Wednesday, April 24, at 5 p.m. Your submission should include the following:

The blog post author’s name and title
The link to the blog post OR the blog post in a Word document
Any photos or links to video that you would like to include
You or your organization’s Twitter handle (if you have one)
Please add the following language and logo to the end of your post:

This post is part of the YWCA Stand Against Racism blog carnival – we invite you to join the dialogue! Post your comment below, share your story and follow the conversation on Twitter with the hashtag #StandAgainstRacism.

I’m impressed, I have to admit. Rarely do I come across a blog that’s both equally educative and
interesting, and without a doubt, you’ve hit the nail on the
head. The problem is something which not enough men and women are speaking intelligently about.
Now i’m very happy I stumbled across this in my hunt for something relating to this.

Helpful info. Lucky me I discovered your site by accident,
and I am shocked why this accident didn’t came about in advance!
I bookmarked it.

Today, I went to the beach with my kids. I
found a sea shell and gave it to my 4 year old daughter
and said “You can hear the ocean if you put this to your ear.” She put the shell to
her ear and screamed. There was a hermit crab inside and it pinched her ear.
She never wants to go back! LoL I know this is completely off topic but I
had to tell someone!

The other day, while I was at work, my cousin stole
my iPad and tested to see if it can survive a twenty five foot drop, just so she
can be a youtube sensation. My apple ipad is now destroyed and
she has 83 views. I know this is totally off topic but I had to share it with someone!

naturally like your web site but you have to
test the spelling on several of your posts. Many of them are rife with spelling
issues and I to find it very troublesome to inform the reality on the other hand I will definitely
come back again.
