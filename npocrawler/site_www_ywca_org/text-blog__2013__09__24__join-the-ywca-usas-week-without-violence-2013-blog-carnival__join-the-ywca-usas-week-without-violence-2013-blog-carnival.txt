Join the YWCA USA’s Week Without Violence™ 2013 Blog Carnival!
September 24, 2013

Tags: blog carnival, family, partner violence, rape, stalking, Take Action, violence, Week Without Violence, women, ywca 



By Katie Stanton
Social Media & Online Engagement Manager, YWCA USA
According to the American Medical Association, more than 20% of women in the United States have experienced intimate-partner violence, stalking or both. A full 17% have reported rape or attempted rape. On average, 24 people per minute are victims of rape, physical violence, or stalking by an intimate partner in the United States (CDC).
We all know someone who has experienced violence – she might be a family member, a friend, a co-worker. All too often, they are us. 
The YWCA Week Without Violence™, held annually every third week in October, is a signature initiative created by YWCA USA nearly 20 years ago to mobilize people in communities across the United States to take action against all forms of violence, wherever it occurs. Each year, YWCAs all around the country host local Week Without Violence™ events and create a public dialogue about violence, in all of its forms.
Women and girls can face interlocking barriers, such as sexism and racism, which play integral roles in our understanding and awareness of how and why violence is propagated. The question for many on the front lines becomes: how can we more effectively encourage our communities to help put an end to all forms of violence, while considering the influence of systems like racism and sexism? How can we, as communities and as a larger society, work to change our culture of violence – whether it is through the language we use, the cultural values and social norms we find ourselves adhering to, or the sort of news that gets widely covered? What will it take to end violence against women and girls?
We encourage you to write a blog post telling us what you think it will take to eliminate violence against women and girls in the United States. What are the biggest challenges? What still needs to be done? How have you been involved with ending violence in your community? Check out last year’s blog carnival for inspiration. (Don’t know what a blog carnival is? Click here.)
The YWCA USA will collect the blog posts and publish them throughout the week of October 14 – 20. We will share the posts on Twitter, Facebook and Pinterest using the hashtag #ywcaWWV, and we welcome you to share them, too!
How to Submit Your Post:

Please send your blog posts responding to this prompt to Katie Stanton, YWCA USA Social Media and Online Engagement Manager, at kstanton@ywca.org
Send your post by October 12 – posts will be published from Oct. 14 – 20
Recommended length for blog posts is 300 – 500 words
Please include an author, their title and their short (two sentence) bio, as well as an optional headshot; you may include additional photos and videos
You are welcome to share posts that will also be published on your own websites and blogs – please add the following language and logo to the end of your post:

This post is part of the YWCA Week Without Violence™ 2013 Blog Carnival. We invite you to join the dialogue! Post your comment below, share your story and follow the conversation on Twitter with the hashtag #ywcaWWV. 
We’re looking forward to your stories, experiences, and thoughts on how to end violence!
