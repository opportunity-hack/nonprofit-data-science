YWCA USA to Celebrate Extraordinary Women Leaders
at Women of Distinction Awards Gala!
Honorees Include Beverly Bond, Marilyn Carlson Nelson, Melissa Harris-Perry, Dr. Bernice Johnson Reagon, and Linda Sarsour
 
Robin Givens returns as Host of the Gala
 
Washington, D.C. – YWCA USA will celebrate the incredible achievements of extraordinary leaders who serve as role models for women and girls at the Women of Distinction Awards Gala on June 5, at 6 pm at the Grand Hyatt Washington, as part of their 2015 Annual Conference.
“The Women of Distinction Awards honor remarkable women for their outstanding achievements in improving the lives of women today and creating a fairer society for future generations,” said YWCA USA CEO Dara Richardson-Heron, M.D.
The awards recognize women in the areas of: Advocacy and Civic Engagement, Corporate Social Responsibility, Media and Journalism, Women’s Empowerment and Racial Justice. This year’s honorees are: Linda Sarsour, Marilyn Carlson Nelson, Melissa Harris-Perry, and Beverly Bond.
This year’s Dorothy I. Height Racial Justice Award recipient is Dr. Bernice Johnson Reagon. This award is presented to an individual who has had a national impact in the field of racial justice in the United States. Honorees are selected based on criteria that reflect Dr. Height’s contributions: service in a leadership role, commitment to racial justice and a high standard of courage, integrity and steadfastness in support of the YWCA’s mission to eliminate racism and empower women.
The Gala will be hosted again this year by television, film and stage actress, and advocate Robin Givens. She has served as spokesperson for the National Domestic Violence Hotline and was awarded the Vital Link Award by that organization for her over 20 years of work on behalf of women, children and families facing the challenges of domestic violence. Ms. Givens is also Co-Chair of Women Who Care.
YWCA USA will also recognize three local YWCA associations for their outstanding work in the areas of women’s empowerment, racial justice, and advocacy. There are more than 220 local YWCA associations in the United States providing critically important services and supports in communities large and small, urban and rural. Richardson-Heron said, “We are humbled and honored to highlight the excellent work that YWCAs across the country do everyday to meet the critical needs of women and their families and create change in their communities.”
All media must RSVP. Only credentialed press can register. Media interested in attending the Women of Distinction Awards Gala on June 13, at 6 pm must RSVP to: Anna Olson Nugent at Anna@jamesgrantpr.com or Matt Flynn at: Matt@jamesgrantpr.com or (917) 626-1300.
