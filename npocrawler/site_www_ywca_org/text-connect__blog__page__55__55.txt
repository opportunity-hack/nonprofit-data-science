Wednesday, June 29, 2011

by Nova B. Rutherford Special to YWCA USA Last week, the YWCA turned tension into a teachable moment by creating a forum for positive thought leaders in the aftermath of the hurtful Psychology Today article by Satoshi Kanazawa titled “Why Are Black Women Less Physically Attractive Than Other Women?” The ridiculous theory was quickly discredited… Continue Reading Recap: Beauty and the Beholder Webcast

Tuesday, June 28, 2011

by Stephanie M. Crumpton Special to YWCA USA What is the cost of beauty?  I’m not sure that there’s an actual dollar amount, but what I am certain of is that women are paying for it with their careers, health and sanity when they don’t measure up to the narrow standards of our image-obsessed culture.… Continue Reading The Costs of Beauty: Way Too High a Price to Pay







Support Military Women!
Monday, June 27, 2011

Talking Back & Acting Up: A Metaphor for Women’s Self Definition
Thursday, June 9, 2011

By Stephanie M. Crumpton Special to YWCA USA It took me a minute, but I’m glad she’s around.  Some of you shake your head when you think of her, but something about her still commands your respect and maybe even your secret adoration.  Who is “She?”  The woman who just isn’t scared to speak up… Continue Reading Talking Back & Acting Up: A Metaphor for Women’s Self Definition







YWCA to Host May 12 Live Online Event on Rape Kit Backlog and VAWA
Monday, May 9, 2011

Fifteen out of 16 rapists never spend a day in jail. Undetected repeat offenders commit 91% of all rapes. Yet across the nation, hundreds of thousands of rape evidence kits remain unprocessed. These unprocessed rape kits are justice denied for the thousands of women who are raped in the U.S. each year — and the… Continue Reading YWCA to Host May 12 Live Online Event on Rape Kit Backlog and VAWA

At the Conference: Laura Garza, YWCA San Antonio
Friday, April 8, 2011

by Laura Garza YWCA San Antonio (TX) Capitol Hill Day was a great experience; enjoyed talking to congressmen and staff.  I hope that they got the message that cutting CCDBG (Child Care and Development Block Grant Act) and CDBG (Community Development Block Grant) is not the answer.  These cuts are going to impact our women… Continue Reading At the Conference: Laura Garza, YWCA San Antonio
