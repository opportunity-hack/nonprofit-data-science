It’s here! YWCA USA’s Stand Against Racism 2013 Blog Carnival
April 26, 2013

The YWCA USA is proud to convene our blog carnival for Stand Against Racism today. Stand Against Racism is an annual event that serves as a conversation-starter about racial justice and diversity, and what we can do to achieve true equality in our communities. Racial justice is an integral and defining part of the work of the YWCA. Stand Against Racism is a signature event that furthers our mission to eliminate racism and empower women across the country.
This year, we asked: “What will it take to create a community that is free of racism in all forms?”
Responses have come from local YWCAs and guest bloggers from across the U.S. We’re posting responses throughout the day! Check out the posts below, and if you have a post that you’d like to include, email Katie Stanton at kstanton@ywca.org or link to it in the comments below.

Ideally, a world, a country, a state, a city that would promote the equality of women to men would remove or minimize much of the burden from women. Similarly, a country free of racism will further alleviate the load on women. But the reality of how women would benefit extends beyond this, whereas women are the ones primarily affected when race and gender inequalities coincide, the human race as a whole is disadvantaged and the ability for evolution slows down by these injustices.

First of all I would like to say excellent blog! I had a
quick question in which I’d like to ask if you don’t mind.
I was curious to know how you center yourself and clear your mind before writing.
I’ve had a difficult time clearing my mind in getting my
ideas out. I do take pleasure in writing however it just seems like the first 10 to 15 minutes tend to
be lost just trying to figure out how to begin. Any suggestions or tips?
Many thanks!
