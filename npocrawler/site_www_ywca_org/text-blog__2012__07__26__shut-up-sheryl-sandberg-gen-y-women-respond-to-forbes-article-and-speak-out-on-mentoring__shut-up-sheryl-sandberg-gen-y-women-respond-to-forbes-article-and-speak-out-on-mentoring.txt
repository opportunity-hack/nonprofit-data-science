“Shut Up, Sheryl Sandberg”: Gen Y Women Respond to Forbes Article and Speak Out on Mentoring
July 26, 2012

Maureen Henderson, Jenna Lodge, Kelsie Boyd, mentoring, mentors, millennials, Rachel Libelo, Sheryl Sandberg, Shut Up Sheryl Sandberg, Solveig Pedersen, Stephanie Pliskin, women, women CEOs, workplace, young women, ywca 



“Only 20% of Gen Y women say that they want to follow in the footsteps of the female leaders in their workplaces,” according to the Forbes piece.  “[A] survey of 1000 college-educated Millennials found that while 84% of respondents said that they could identify at least one female leader at their job, most didn’t want to emulate her career path.”J. Maureen Henderson’s recent Forbes article, “Shut Up, Sheryl Sandberg: Millennial Women Reject Role Models, Mentors,” generated a lot of reaction and caused many women – of all ages – to ask: are Gen Y women really rejecting older women CEOs as role models?
We asked six young women at YWCAs across the country to share their thoughts about the article, and about intergenerational relationships and mentoring in general. Here’s what they said:
Q: Is the Forbes article an accurate depiction of how young women feel about older female leaders? 
Kelsie Boyd, 23: Sadly, the article does describe a true reflection on how young women view female leaders.  I regret this to be true of my generation in a broad spectrum because I feel that young women have a lot to gain by learning from the advice and wisdom of women who have led similar career paths.
Carmille Lim, 25: The Forbes piece misrepresents the perception I feel my fellow millennial women professionals have – we are not rejecting mentors; we are just processing “mentorship” in a different way. The article acknowledges that both parties have different career goals: the mentor is typically an older female leader who has climbed the corporate ladder and would like to groom someone to follow in her footsteps. Young women in mentee positions are not aspiring to climb the corporate ladder in as high numbers as their mentors. Instead, more young women are seeking a career path that allows them to be innovative and creative and that’s personally fulfilling.

Stephanie Pliskin, 29: I don’t understand why some view the article so negatively.  Just because women aren’t choosing to follow in their high-powered CEO’s footsteps does not mean they are not empowered.  Empowerment means the ability to choose and no one should fault those women for choosing a different path, nor insinuate that they are failing.  Everyone’s goals are different and should be celebrated regardless of pay scale or corporate power.
Solveig Pedersen, 33: I believe that mentorship is still very important, and I do seek out female professional mentors.  I find it fascinating that my own perspectives about mentorship and role models are reflected in the Forbes article.
 Rachel Libelo,24: I don’t think young women are completely shrugging off the advice of older, more experienced workers in their field. They just want to make their own way rather than following in someone else’s footsteps. In today’s employment environment, there’s so much emphasis on being unique – to get noticed, you have to stand out from the rest. Once young women get into that mindset, it’s hard to get out. We still value the advice from more experienced women, but we’re going to use that guidance in our own way to advance our career.
Carmille: The article looks at mentoring with a traditional lens: the mentor expects to have a protégé – someone to perpetuate current best practices in existing business settings of long-standing corporations. On the other hand, young women professionals are not seeking to replicate an individual or perpetuate an organizational entity as it stands. Instead, the type of mentoring they are seeking are opportunities to learn tools, tips and best practices, so that they can combine this knowledge with their own strengths and industries in order to create new businesses, improve upon ideas or reinvent existing business models.
Q: What can both older women and younger women do to bridge the generation gap at the workplace and beyond?
 Jenna Lodge, 27: This reminds me of the old adage, “History repeats itself.” All generations of women must be adaptable in their learning, mindset and outlook.  Young women don’t want to ignore the amazing work of the women that have come before us, including older women in the movement. Young women want to learn the history of our organization while infusing it with our own ideas. Just because an idea may be new and different does not make it less worthy of contemplation.  Through mentor relationships, older women can create safe spaces for young women to learn and grow within the movement in their own unique ways.  Given the opportunity, young women will rise to the occasion, embrace new concepts and build upon the success of women before us.  We strive for excellence and want to make a positive impact for generations behind us to follow.  I think older women would get a great sense of satisfaction knowing that a younger female can confidently say, “She helped me become the woman I am today!”
Rachel: Rather than trying to bridge the generation gap by “meeting the other half way,” it’s better to recognize the value in each others’ differences. That may seem like a cliché answer, but age diversity in an organization is important – especially for a nonprofit that survives on donations. Older women provide insights from years of experience; they already know what works and what doesn’t. Younger women know how to reach a younger demographic, which is important for staying relevant and competitive in a technological age. To be successful, women should actively listen to one another and take advantage of varying perspectives.
Q: What do you personally look for in a role model or mentor, both professionally and personally? 
Solveig: I recently spoke with a female leader I admire about work/personal life balance.  She explained to me that she has given all of her energy and time to her professional life, and in retrospect, at 65 years old, she wishes that she had allowed for more balance with other areas of her life.  This conversation affirmed me in my personal search for balance and my own recognition that I seek professional mentors who share my values. I do not want to live to work – I want to work to live.  I want to succeed at work and contribute to my work place and community.  I want the time I spend working to be meaningful, but I also want plenty of time to pursue passions outside of work such as volunteering, having a family and traveling.  If I found a mentor who did not share those values, their advice would have only limited value to me.
Rachel: For me, one of the most important things a mentor can do is offer perspective. Sometimes I get bogged down if I’m not being as effective as I’d like or if I’m working on a particularly tedious project. To me it feels like the end of the world, which of course it’s not. Having a mentor is great because she can change the context of the situation by helping you see a larger picture.
Kelsie: I look for qualities such as wisdom, positive reinforcement and the ability to constructively criticize while sharing their own experiences.  I have been so fortunate to have had this experience in my career path thus far.  It really stood out to me that 79 percent of women in the article rate a positive work environment as more important than the size of our paycheck.  I believe this says a lot about the amazing influence positive women leaders can have on the younger generation workers.
Q: What do you want older women to know about you and your generation? 
Solveig: I want other generations to understand how much energy, intelligence and passion young women can bring to the workplace.  I also want them to understand that the value placed on balance does not mean that we do not work as hard, or remain as passionate about our work as they do.  This emphasis on balance simply means that I know I will be more productive at work if I am not stressed out, overworked and spending all my time in the office.  The balance allows me to bring my full self, with drive and enthusiasm, to my job.
Carmille: While young women may not want to be a duplicate of an accomplished female leader and follow the same career aspirations, young women do appreciate the idea of learning best practices from older women leaders. They may just apply that knowledge differently than their mentor expected.

Young women also are BORED with the discussion about how to balance work and kids. We want the workplace to change. When our generation comes to power I find it very unlikely that we will spend 5 days a week sitting at a desk. We will utilize flexible scheduling, telecommuting, and partners who are also invested in our children’s lives to be happy, balanced, successful people. Having it all is no longer a baby in a briefcase.

I completely agree with you Danielle! It feel so stuffy and traditional to “clock-in” the 9to5 routine. I think alot more millennial women are comfortable in examining other non-traditional family structures as well. MY end goal is to live in a society where innovation is not only encouraged but openly explored–given women the option to craft their own working structure.

I am happy to say that much of this I have learned from my colleagues and (wo)mentors at the YWCA. My office is run very flexibly with the option to work from home. When/if I work in a different environment I think I will have a difficult time adjusting to the rigidity after having been given this high level of trust and respect.

I spent four years trying EVERYTHING in Online Dating, and through a huge amount of trial and error, I produced a system that I will share for you. This book will take you, step by step, through everything you need to know to double, triple or even quadruple the number of women you meet online.

If you ever tried Phallomax, pls post your thoughts here. I am about to test it out. Have read about those pills some very good reviews. Just wondering on how many more inches would that thing add to my little friend down there lol 😀

I’ve used Phallomax for the past few months. No doubts it’s obviously the best solution for “that” problem. Received it from the UK very quickly and I live in Seychelles. Well worth the money.

Awesome post. Btw have you heard about this product: http://bit.ly/2N5npwG Seems like it’s one of those products you don’t normally talk about. Did come across it a week ago and decided I’ll test it out just to see how good it is. Found some video reviews on Dailymotion and they look legit (I mean not scripted). Not many products out there have so many positive opinions. Have a look on it, maybe this can finally solve our problems (or at least yours).
