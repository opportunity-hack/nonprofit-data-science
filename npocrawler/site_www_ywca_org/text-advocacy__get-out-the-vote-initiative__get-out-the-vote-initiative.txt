Get Out the Vote
Civic Engagement
Make sure you and your friends and loved ones are registered to vote, be sure to double-check your registration, and develop a plan for voting well in advance of the election – whether that be voting by mail, voting early, or showing up to the polls on November 3rd! Click on the buttons below to get started.
This is your voice, your vote, your future.







 






A few helpful reminders and ideas
PLEASE NOTE: it is important to verify your registration information and your state’s voting process through your local election office’s website for the most reliable, up-to-date information. Due to COVID-19, some voting requirements and options in your state may shift in the coming months.

Register To Vote
Register to vote in this election using YWCA’s easy, online voter registration form, and help your friends, family, colleagues, and neighbors register by sharing the form, our QR code, and our flyer with your community. Be sure to register before your state’s deadline!

Confirm Your Registration Status
If you’re already registered to vote, you’ll need to check your voter registration to confirm it is still active. Make sure to update your registration if you’ve moved or your name has changed since you last voted.

Get Your Absentee Ballot
Get to know the election process in your state! The 2020 General Election will be held on November 3rd across the United States, but the voting process – including deadlines, options, and barriers – vary widely by state. Check your state or local election office’s website to familiarize yourself with your state’s voting process and upcoming deadlines.
Develop your plan to vote! Will you be voting early in person? By mail? On Election Day? Consider adding reminders of upcoming deadlines to your calendar, and consider picking three friends, family members, colleagues, or neighbors who might otherwise not vote and encourage them to develop their own voting plan.
Absentee ballots 
Early voting 
In-person voting on Election Day
SHOW UP ON ELECTION DAY! Whether voting early in person, by mail, or on November 3rd, follow through on your plan to vote!


Pledge To Vote
TAKE THE YWCA PLEDGE TO VOTE! And encourage your friends, family, colleagues, and neighbors to take the pledge as well! That friend who just isn’t into politics? Your cousin who just turned 18? Help them see the value in showing up to the polls, and encourage them to pledge to vote this election!

Spread The Word
Share the GOTV tools and resources above with everyone you know digitally, through social media, text, or email and use the hashtag #YWomenVote to amplify your efforts!
You can also support and help women, especially women of color, get to the polls in person this year. Consider writing to  your neighbors to share the tools above, joining phone or text banking efforts, or printing and posting the resources in well-frequented places like your local library, laundromats, or grocery stores – it’s time to get creative! Check out YWCA’s 2020 GOTV toolkit for more ideas and support your local YWCA in their GOTV efforts this fall!
Because together we can help build political power in our communities and make sure women get to the polls, and that our experiences and needs are valued, represented, and made a priority to those we elect to public office. This is your voice. Your vote. Your future. #YWomenVote!
