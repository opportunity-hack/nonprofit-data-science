Desiree Hoffman
Today is an important day for the YWCA and for all the women we serve.  Here in our nation’s capital, 250 YWCA leaders — from Oregon to New York, Texas to North Dakota — are gathered today to advocate for women, girls and families. Not just the ones that come through the doors of our 1,300 locations across the U.S. every day, but for ALL women and girls.
United to serve 2 million women and girls across country, YWCA is a force to be reckoned with!
Today we’re visiting the offices 241 members of Congress. Our goal is to educate the members and their staffs on the importance of legislative issues that are critical to YWCA’s mission of eliminating racism and empowering women. These meetings focus on securing full funding for these key priorities:

Child Care Development Block Grant (CCDBG)  – a  vital funding stream that provides child care subsidies to low and moderate income families. CCDBG keeps people gainfully employed by providing quality affordable child care and gives children access to quality early childhood education.


Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) — YWCAs depend on CDBG to provide core services. CDBG provides support for infrastructure, including YWCA buildings that house community programs and shelters. It’s an important source of funding for key YWCA programs, such as sexual assault and violence prevention programs and services, transitional housing for those escaping violence at home, and job training programs that empower women to support themselves and their families


Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) and Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) Funding – Funding for VAWA and VOCA support much-needed domestic violence, sexual assault , emergency shelters, transitional shelters – critical services to help survivors and victims of crime pick up the pieces after trauma when they need it most. Tomorrow we’re looking forward to hearing Vice President Joe Biden speak about the importance of VAWA at our luncheon.


Reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act– with VAWA reauthorization on the move, this is a critical legislative time. The Senate to a positive step forward by passing their version of the 68-31 last week. While there is overwhelming bipartisan support, there are key provisions of VAWA at risk of being stripped from the House version bill, including protection for Native American, immigrant and LGBT communities. YWCA supports HR 4271, the House version of VAWA sponsored by U.S. Rep Gwen Moore (D-WI), and our goal is to get as many cosponsors as possible.

Our fight today is every woman’s fight. Join us. Even if you aren’t in Washington, D.C., today, you can let your voice be heard!  Wherever you live, participate in YWCA’s National Day of Action by calling and emailing your Congressional reps to stand up for women in your community.

I am empowered and today even grateful for finding you here online with this very vital information. I am living in an emergency shelter and because the women there are all different it is important for me to say that the advocacy of the YWCA is a vital part of society which we must continue to  foster with the best research and evidence to assist women. I have found that what the poor woman looks like and is means many things. The emergency of lost income holds so many issues that blatant judgement is no longer a fruitful tool for the adversary. I want to see more ministries for the victim of domestic violence as I have seen women take hold of many problems stemming from the black eye  or traumatic date. Thank you for your work and keep up the faith that women who know will do something better.

Woah! I’m really loving the template/theme of this website.
It’s simple, yet effective. A lot of times it’s very difficult to get that “perfect balance” between user friendliness and visual appearance.
I must say you have done a awesome job with this.
Also, the blog loads extremely fast for me on Safari.
Exceptional Blog!
