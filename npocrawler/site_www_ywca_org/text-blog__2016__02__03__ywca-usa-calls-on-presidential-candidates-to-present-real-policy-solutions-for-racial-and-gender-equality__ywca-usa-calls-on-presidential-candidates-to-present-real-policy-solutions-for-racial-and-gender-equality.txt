YWCA USA Calls on Presidential Candidates to Present Real Policy Solutions for Racial and Gender Equality
February 3, 2016

Washington, DC, February 4, 2016 — Today, YWCA USA CEO Dara Richardson-Heron, M.D., released the following statement ahead of February’s presidential debates, urging a change in tone in discussions about women and race. For more than 150 years, YWCA has worked to eliminate racism, empower women, stand up for social justice, help families, and strengthen our communities. Richardson-Heron’s statement follows:
“It is time to elevate the dialogue in our country when it comes to women and people of color. The 2016 presidential campaign has seen these as touchstone issues, and some candidates have proposed policies and made statements that would worsen current inequities. We need candidates and elected officials to create, champion, and sign into law real policy solutions that address racial and gender inequality in the United States.
“YWCA has been a leader in many of the most critical social movements from voting rights and civil rights, to affordable housing and pay equity, to domestic violence prevention and health care reform. We will not stand by and let the work we have done be jeopardized by those who do not understand or care about the needs of the women, girls, and families that we serve. Women, girls, and communities of color cannot wait any longer to see tangible change on issues like workplace fairness, racial profiling, and violence against women and girls.
“Every day, YWCA creates solutions that address injustice. Our 225 local YWCAs across the country provide programs that seek to end violence against women and girls, ensure racial justice and civil rights, and promote health and wellness, economic advancement, and empowerment of women and girls.
“We urge those in positions of power, and those who may be in positions of power, to share our commitment to creating a more just America.”
If you would like to interview Dr. Richardson-Heron, please contact Chris Lisi at (202) 549-0696 or clisi@ywca.org.
