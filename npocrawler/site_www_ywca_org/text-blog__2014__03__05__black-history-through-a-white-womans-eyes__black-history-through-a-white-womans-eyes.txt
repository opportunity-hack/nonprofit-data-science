Black History through a White Woman’s Eyes
March 5, 2014

Tags: african americans, black history month, chicago, diversity, integration, racial justice, relationships, stereotypes, ywca mclean county 



By Norene G. Ball
Director of Hallmark Programs, YWCA McLean County
February was Black History Month and March is Women’s History Month. My own limited life experience convinces me that both Black History Month and Women’s History Month are good ideas. I grew up in the ’50s and early ’60s in a small town that had one black family living there. I never interacted with that family. Consequently, I grew up knowing nothing about black people. I had no idea of the contributions they make or the lives they lead. I saw blacks in stores or on the street, but since they were not a part of my world, the only information I had was the racial stereotypes and prejudices of my family and friends.
When I graduated from high school in 1965, I went for training as a dental assistant in Chicago Heights, Illinois. For the first time, I saw large groups of black kids hanging out together, and it terrified me, but there was one black girl in my classes. For the first time, I saw a black person as an individual and I learned we had a lot in common.
I finished school, met and married my first husband, and had a baby. When we were in the process of building our home, a black family started a home in the neighborhood. One night, vandals came into the sub-division and knocked down the framework of the black family’s house. The next day, my father-in-law was at their property with his tractor, helping to clean up the mess the vandals had made. I knew the haters were still out there and their children probably went to the same school that my little daughter attended. There was fear, but more than fear; there was also pride. Our family had taken a stand for justice. Intuitively I knew it was the right thing to do, and that gave me courage.
Over the years, I still lived my separate life, encountering people of color now and again, but never having a close black friend. I started working at YWCA McLean County in the Senior Services program. Soon I found myself in charge of programs for our women. I attended meetings where we talked about racial inequality and injustices committed against people of color. A side benefit of my involvement in the organization is that I met a black woman who took a chance and befriended me. I will never forget the look of pain on her face when she heard that employees of a local business were caught on audio tape denigrating black people. “No matter what we do or what we accomplish, it’s never enough,” she said. The goal for my life became to help create an environment in which every person is given the opportunity to be all they were created to be and contribute to society in a way that fits with who they are. I learned that there were far too many people still living in a “separate” world, as I had done.
Upon reviewing YWCA McLean County’s history, there are some real shining moments. In the late ’40s, YWCA members, including the only African-American board member, held sit-ins at area “whites only” restaurants, including the YWCA’s own tea room. In 1952, we invited the Director of the Chicago Commission on Human Relations to discuss a race riot in Cicero that happened when an African-American family moved into the all-white community. In 1955, YWCA McLean County named our first African-American Board President. Recently, we have sponsored summits on racial justice, held study circles to educate people, and participated in “Not In Our Town” events to send the message that hatred and intolerance is not welcomed in this community. We hosted a racial justice council where area agencies and people interested in the issues could come to share ideas and tell their stories.
But the work has just begun. A local radio station is doing a series of interviews entitled “In Their Own Words.” The series was inspired by interviews conducted by Zora Neale Hurston in the 1930s. Hurston traveled throughout the South inviting Black Americans to share their experiences, memories and aspirations. The local radio station is asking people of color in our community to do the same. A handful of the stories have aired and the experiences are not all positive. There is still a divide in our community and society. Women and people of color have so many stories about their individual and group experiences that need to be heard. Given the diversity of our community, there are numerous opportunities to learn and grow.
It makes me sad to look back over my life and realize the opportunities I have missed because I was afraid to get to know people that were “different” from me. The precious relationships that I have with other women and  people of color have enriched my life so much, and I know my life would have been much fuller if it had been populated with a variety of people.
If I had begun, at an early age, to learn about the historical accomplishments and contributions of women and people of color, respect and appreciation could have grown along with my knowledge. Relationships would have been established through common interests and curiosity about the stories of others. I would have learned what it is like to live in another person’s world. I would have discovered that we share some basic human values, and that attitudes are often shaped by our personal experiences. It might even have resulted in our worlds coming closer together. I know it would have given me more confidence to follow my dreams, and more courage to be myself, rather than the girl/woman others expected me to be. I would have spent my time and energy working for positive change in the world, rather turning myself inside out to please other people. I want today’s children to have the opportunity to see into other worlds, broaden their own, and know the people that inhabit their world. And I want them to be all they are created to be, because that makes this a better place for all of us.
Norene Ball is the Director of Hallmark Programs for YWCA McLean County, Illinois.  She grew up in northern Illinois, but has lived in Bloomington, Illinois since 1979.  She has received the Illinois Municipal Human Relations Association Award and the Baha’i Light of Unity Award.

I think what you composed made a ton of sense.
But, consider this, what if you typed a catchier post title?
I ain’t suggesting your content isn’t good, however what if you added a post title to maybe get people’s attention? I
mean Black History through a White Woman’s Eyes – YWCA USA
is a little boring. You should peek at Yahoo’s home page and see how they create post titles to get
people to click. You might add a video or a pic or two to grab readers interested about everything’ve written. Just my opinion, it could
make your posts a little bit more interesting.

The Positive Effects of Reiki for the Human Body
Reiki is recognized for its positive results about the
human body. However, lots of people of people who have not yet experienced its power determine what exactly Reiki does and what its effects are.
If you are thinking about the way in which Reiki will help

1. Increases your body’s capacity to heal itself. Normally, our bodies has a
defense system which functions good as long as the Ki flow just isn’t interrupted.
When the Ki has stopped being capable of flow through one’s body, illnesses and diseases can appear.
Reiki stimulates the flow of positive energy, thus enabling your body to heal itself and fight the external and internal attacks better.
2. Cleans our bodies of all toxins. Because it acts around the entire body, it really is one
of the few complete detox programs one can follow. In addition to that this doesn’t involve refraining from food or some other type of activity.
Yet, pessimism have to be banned from your individual’s mind because they may have a negative impact upon treatments.
3. Promotes health, positive thoughts and relaxation. The principles of Reiki count on positive thinking, thus a satisfaction and relaxation is induced towards the individual.
By removing negative energy and promoting a sense peace, the recovery process will be easier and shorter, regardless
of illness or disease from which the person suffers.
4. Works for the digestive tract and increases the benefic
results of every thing somebody ingests, from
food and water to medicines and curative herbs. Thus, it may be used successfully being a complementary therapy for anyone already taking medicine, but as well
it can be great for maintain the consumer’s health in good parameters.
5. Works on personal feelings, helping people overcome negative experiences off their lives and managing
unexpected or unpleasant situations using their lives.
People with depressions, anxieties or being affected by stress can easily see dramatic improvements
of the conditions following your Reiki sessions.
6. Makes the transition from life to death less difficult.
It helps the soul transcend into immortality and the body feel less struggling with this transformation. This
is why many Reiki adepts use the Ki to generate their transition in one world to a different smoother.

A Parent’s Guide to Eczema.As a parent, you strive to give your child a happy and healthy life, but what if they suffer from eczema? The uncontrollable urge to itch and the unknown causes may be too much for you and your child to bear.As a parent, what are you to do?It is common to find rashes on children, but eczema is more than just a rash. It is skin condition that can turn into a struggle for both parents and children. You may have never heard of eczema until your child was diagnosed with it, but now what?Keep Your Child’s Skin Moisturized.There are different eczema trigger factors, which can lead to an outbreak.These trigger factors may include dust, stress, sweat, and laundry detergent.However, for some children, the cause is nothing more than dry skin. We instinctively want to touch and itch dry skin to provide relief and children do the same. Moisturize your child each day.Their itching may not completely cease, but you should notice an improvement.When moisturizing your child, aim for application throughout the day. However, the most important step is to moisturize their body immediately following a bath or shower. Your goal is to lock in the moisture.If your child is old enough, get them in the habit of reaching for moisturizer each time they feel the need to itch.Protect Your Child’s Skin.Eczema outbreaks are typically severe in small children.They don’t understand the complications that can arise from constant scratching; therefore, they continue to itch.If your child is old enough, have an eczema discussion with them. Encourage them to apply lotion or inform you whenever they feel the need to itch.However, for small children, such as toddlers and preschoolers, you need to protect your child’s skin yourself.As previously stated, the first line of protection is constant moisture. The second is to keep the area prone to outbreaks covered.This is especially important at night, as some children actually scratch their arms and legs in their sleep. When later asked, some are even unaware of their actions.The less direct contact the fingernails have with the skin, the less damage is done.Seek Medical Attention for Skin Infections.Most cases of eczema in children can be treated at home.However, children are at an increased risk for skin infections.Eczema creates the uncontrollable urge to itch. Your child may continue scratching until the skin is broken, leaving an open wound.Children will be children and that means coming into contact with many germs and bacteria.Combine these with an open wound and there is an increased risk for a skin infection.Treat your child’s eczema at home, but seek medical attention if you suspect the onset of infection.As a parent, you are unable to cure your child’s eczema, but you help protect them from the lifelong complications, such as scars.

How to Become a Master Candle Maker For Fun or Profit…Soon, you’ll finally learn how to make wonderful smelling candles that put those expensive candles sold in stores to shame.It’s easy, fun and very rewarding!If you’ve ever had a deep desire to make beautiful, scent-filled candles that make any room welcoming and maybe given as special gifts…Or better yet, if you want to create a full-time income from your candles, then this is the most important information you’ll ever read.They come to craft shows with a basket filled with unique, colorful, and wonderfully smelling candles.The type of candles that make those expensive candles that you bought for your mother’s birthday look amateurish!They display their crafts in perfect arrangements, as a mile-long line forms around their table.Then, when you catch another glimpse of the table cloth, the array of sweet-smelling gifts vanishes as fast as it had collected above the table cloth.The crafter folds her table cloth, closes her money bank, and then quickly walks out the door early.This is the same person who, when you visit her house, you are hypnotized by the welcoming aura as soon as you step on her front walkway.You can’t help but think, “How could anyone resist taking a few steps toward her door?.”If you knew me, you’d be surprised to know that a friend of mine told me that the very situation above was how she felt about me.What she doesn’t know is that I wasn’t born with natural talents in candle making.My craft actually started as a hobby.My interest in being the best candle maker I could be, lead me to take many classes to learn how to perfect my art.I also read books and researched everything I could.I discovered that while there was tons of information available, only a tiny bit of it was actually useful.I was also fortunate to have the help of many candle makers from whom I learned how to be a master at candle making and how to impress everyone with my great smelling candles.You can read more info about candle making here : http://www.candlemaking4you.1s.fr/

Create Energy When Talking On Your Phone. More and more people are afraid that they will have to give up some of the household appliances they have so much longed for because the energy consumption is far above their financial possibilities.Thus, after months or even years of saving money in order to purchase what they want and like the most, many individuals see the need of getting rid of them because they no longer can afford paying huge electricity bills.Most of the times giving up those electrical appliances also means giving up comfort and turning back to a lifestyle characteristic to the past years, it means frustration and sorrow and sometimes even hours wasted by doing by hand something which an electrical appliance can do in a few minutes.If your electricity bill is sucking out your last pennies, then you probably know what I am talking about.However, this situation which for many people seems hopeless can be solved in a much easier and comfortable way.All you need in order to diminish your energy bill is another source of energy, a cheap and easy to use source that will provide you with enough energy to power small appliances and significantly lower the amount of power you use from the national or local electricity provider.This power source, which can represent your salvation, is the banal phone line.Each and every day, power runs through the phone cables, power which is mainly used for keeping the phone working and sustaining the conversation.During the day, this power is used, as people are talking on the phone, but during the late hours of the night the number of people using the phone line is relatively low, so that you can gather all that energy and use it to power your appliances.This energy is included in your phone bill, so there is something you pay for, thus you have all the right to use something for which you pay.To fully take advantage of this type of power you will need a device which will gather the energy from the phone and make it ready for use.The good thing about this device is that, even though it is more efficient during the night, it can also be used during the day or even when you are speaking on the phone.You will see that in a few months you will be able to use all your appliances and still save money on your electricity bill to fulfill some of your dreams.
