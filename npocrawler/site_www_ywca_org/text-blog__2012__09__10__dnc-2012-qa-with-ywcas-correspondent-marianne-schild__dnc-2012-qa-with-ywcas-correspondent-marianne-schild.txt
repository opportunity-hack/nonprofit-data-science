DNC 2012: Q&A with YWCA’s Correspondent Marianne Schild
September 10, 2012



by Marianne Schild
YWCA Correspondent at DNC
Marianne Schild
Staff, volunteers and YWCA supporters from across YWCA’s national network submitted questions to me during the 2012 Democratic National Convention in Charlotte. Here are some of the highlights:
Q: What will the Affordable Care Act (ACA) do to support women’s health issues, such as access to affordable healthcare if you have a preexisting condition, or access to affordable healthcare for those who are unemployed or underemployed?
Under the ACA it is illegal to deny someone coverage for a preexisting condition; this act of denying someone coverage had a greater impact on women’s health because of health issues unique to women, such as pregnancy and childbirth. When Kathleen Sebelius, Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) addressed the crowd, she stated “Being a woman is no longer a preexisting condition.”
Vice President Joe Biden on the Jumbotron screen at the Democratic National Convention.
At CarolinaFest, conversations about women’s health were ongoing.  I asked people that I encountered on the streets of Charlotte what they thought of a map that depicted 12.8 million women who were previously uninsured who are now insured under the Affordable Care Act.  Some responded positively. One mentioned having a sister who is a student and too old to fall under their parents’ health insurance, so this new policy will benefit her since the new law allows students until the age of 26 to remain on their parents’ coverage. Others questioned the validity of the numbers represented in the map and asked how I came to these figures.
Q: How did the Convention address topics of college affordability?  
At the DNC, we learned of a new policy to make student loan payments more affordable for graduates.  Student loan payments will not go above a certain percentage of one’s income for the first 20 years they are out of school.  As a nonprofit staffer, I recently read an article in Philanthropy Journal about college grads who go to work for nonprofits and cannot afford their living expenses in addition to college loan payments on their lean salaries, yet they find their work so fulfilling they do not want to quit.  President Obama mentioned in his speech that this new policy to subsidize loans for college education will encourage people to work in jobs serving the public which are vital to our society.
President Obama has also doubled Pell Grants for college education.
Q: How is the food at the DNC? The weather?
The food at the DNC Delegate welcome party was marvelous, but the food at the convention was not that great. I arrived at the arena each evening by 5 p.m. to see the gavel initiate the programming, and I was there until the gavel came down to close the evening usually between 12 midnight and 1 a.m. Dinner each night in the arena consisted of chicken fingers or cheeseburgers and water gulped quickly on the concourse so I wouldn’t lose my seat in the arena. (I normally eat locally-grown, organic foods with more vegetables that anything else, as a point of reference.)
Q: How did the Convention address improving the lives of working families? While we are focused on the important attacks on women’s reproductive rights, the courts have ruled and Roe v. Wade stands. While it is important to not allow legislation that chips away at that, the larger issues include fair pay, comprehensive VAWA, voter restriction laws and deferred action that allows young people to succeed.   
Convention speakers did address fair pay, the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), voter restriction laws and the issues uniquely faced by women and young people.
Regarding fair pay, Lilly Ledbetter herself spoke on Tuesday evening and told her story about fighting for equal pay and losing in court. Women in the U.S. only make $0.77 for every $1.00 men make. The law that President Obama signed in January enacting fair pay for women bears Ledbetter’s name.
When Second Lady Dr. Jill Biden introduced her husband, she mentioned his writing the Violence Against Women Act as a Senator.  Vice President Biden also mentioned VAWA as a proud achievement in his speech Thursday evening.  The full reauthorization of VAWA is at stake in Congress, and it is vital to supportive programming for women – and for YWCAs across the U.S. who provide support services for women — that it be passed.
Speakers addressed voter restriction laws and questioned the Republican platform that they felt aims to limit the voting capacity of those on the margins of our society, as voter restriction laws would do.
Regarding young people and women specifically, convention speakers encouraged young people to vote.  Under 40 percent of voters ages 18 to 24 voted in the most recent election.  If we want our voices heard, we must get out and vote!

I do not know whether it’s just me or if perhaps everybody else encountering issues with your blog.
It looks like some of the text in your content are running off the screen. Can someone else please provide feedback and let me know if this is happening to them too?
This may be a issue with my web browser because I’ve had this happen before.

I believe what you wrote made a lot of sense. But, think on this, what if you added a little content?
I ain’t suggesting your content isn’t solid, but suppose you added something that makes people desire more?
I mean DNC 2012: Q&A with YWCA’s Correspondent Marianne Schild – YWCA
USA is kinda vanilla. You ought to glance at Yahoo’s home page and watch how they create article headlines to get viewers to click.
You might try adding a video or a picture or two to get people interested about
what you’ve written. Just my opinion, it would make your blog
a little livelier.

Even so, I appologize, because I do not give credence to your whole plan, all be it exhilarating none the less.

The Positive Effects of Reiki for the Human Body
Reiki is known for its positive results for
the human body. However, lots of people of people who have never yet experienced
its power know very well what exactly Reiki does and what its
final results are. If you are interested in the best way Reiki can help you, then keep reading to
see what Reiki can do for your, mind and soul.
1. Increases your body’s capacity to heal itself. Normally, the body carries
a defense system which functions good so long as the Ki
flow is not interrupted. When the Ki is not in a position to flow through one’s body, illnesses
and diseases can be displayed. Reiki stimulates the flow
of positive energy, thus enabling your body to heal itself and fight the internal and external attacks better.
2. Cleans our bodies of toxins. Because it acts
around the physique, it really is one of the few complete detox programs one
can possibly follow. In addition to that it doesn’t involve refraining from food
or other type of activity. Yet, pessimism have to be banned
through the individual’s mind because they will have a negative impact
upon the treatment.
3. Promotes health, positive thoughts and relaxation. The principles of Reiki count on positive thinking, thus a peace of mind and
relaxation is induced towards the individual. By removing negative energy and promoting feeling of peace, the recovery
process is going to be easier and shorter,
no matter the illness or disease from which the person suffers.
4. Works about the digestive tract and improves the benefic effects of every
thing a person ingests, from food and water to medicines and
curative herbs. Thus, it may be successfully used as being a complementary therapy
for those already taking medicine, but at the same time it can be
great for maintain the consumer’s health in good parameters.
5. Works on personal feelings, helping people get over negative experiences from their lives and managing unexpected or unpleasant
situations off their lives. People with depressions,
anxieties or struggling with stress can easily see dramatic improvements with their conditions as soon as the
Reiki sessions.
6. Makes the transition from life to death much easier.
It helps the soul transcend into immortality and our bodies feel
less experiencing this transformation. This is why many Reiki adepts utilize Ki to create their
transition from world to another smoother.
Reiki offers healing for all those varieties of bodily conditions,
and then for the spiritual problems. It is
like a closest friend for those those people in need, however it also can relieve healthy people from quotidian stress and problems.

The bulbs are specifically designed to retrofit fluorescent fixtures (T8 in particular, not T12), and specify on the box that no ballast removal is required. I have no safety concerns—especially as they’re in the garage and will only ever be on when someone is in the garage.From a comment on Amazon, if you install them in a T12 fixture, the light will shut off (thermal protection mode) when left on for some length of time. However, someone else commented they’re working fine in their T12 fixture.-rob.

I’m impressed, I have to admit. Genuinely rarely should i encounter a weblog that’s both educative and entertaining, and let me tell you, you may have hit the nail about the head. Your idea is outstanding; the problem is an element that insufficient persons are speaking intelligently about. I am delighted we came across this during my look for something with this.

Create Energy When Talking On Your Phone. More and more people are afraid that they will have to give up some of the household appliances they have so much longed for because the energy consumption is far above their financial possibilities.Thus, after months or even years of saving money in order to purchase what they want and like the most, many individuals see the need of getting rid of them because they no longer can afford paying huge electricity bills.Most of the times giving up those electrical appliances also means giving up comfort and turning back to a lifestyle characteristic to the past years, it means frustration and sorrow and sometimes even hours wasted by doing by hand something which an electrical appliance can do in a few minutes.If your electricity bill is sucking out your last pennies, then you probably know what I am talking about.However, this situation which for many people seems hopeless can be solved in a much easier and comfortable way.All you need in order to diminish your energy bill is another source of energy, a cheap and easy to use source that will provide you with enough energy to power small appliances and significantly lower the amount of power you use from the national or local electricity provider.This power source, which can represent your salvation, is the banal phone line.Each and every day, power runs through the phone cables, power which is mainly used for keeping the phone working and sustaining the conversation.During the day, this power is used, as people are talking on the phone, but during the late hours of the night the number of people using the phone line is relatively low, so that you can gather all that energy and use it to power your appliances.This energy is included in your phone bill, so there is something you pay for, thus you have all the right to use something for which you pay.To fully take advantage of this type of power you will need a device which will gather the energy from the phone and make it ready for use.The good thing about this device is that, even though it is more efficient during the night, it can also be used during the day or even when you are speaking on the phone.You will see that in a few months you will be able to use all your appliances and still save money on your electricity bill to fulfill some of your dreams.

Hey, how’s it going?
I want to pass along some very important news that everyone needs to hear!
In December of 2017, Donald Trump made history by recognizing Jerusalem as the captial of Israel. Why is this big news? Because by this the Jewish people of Israel are now able to press forward in bringing about the Third Temple prophesied in the Bible.
The Jewish people deny Jesus as their Messiah and have stated that their Messiah has been identified and is waiting to be revealed. They say this man will rule the world under a one world religion called “spiritualism”.
They even printed a coin to raise money for the Temple with Donald Trumps face on the front and with king Cyrus'(who built the second Temple) behind him. On the back of the coin is an image of the third Temple.
The Bible says this false Messiah who seats himself in the Third Temple will be thee antichrist that will bring about the Great Tribulation, though the Jewish people believe he will bring about world peace. It will be a false peace for a period of time. You can watch interviews of Jewish Rabbi’s in Israel speaking of these things. They have their plans set in place. It is only years away!
More importantly, the power that runs the world wants to put a RFID microchip in our body making us total slaves to them. This chip matches perfectly with the Mark of the Beast in the Bible, more specifically Revelation 13:16-18:
He causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, and that no one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.
Here is wisdom. Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man: His number is 666.
Referring to the last days, this could only be speaking of a cashless society, which we have yet to see,  but are heading towards. Otherwise, we could still buy or sell without the mark amongst others if physical money was still currency. RFID microchip implant technology will be the future of a one world cashless society containing digital currency. It will be implanted in the right-hand or the forehead, and we cannot buy or sell without it! We must grow strong in Jesus. AT ALL COSTS, DO NOT TAKE IT!
Then a third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, “If anyone worships the beast and his image, and receives his mark on his forehead or on his hand, he himself shall also drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out full strength into the cup of His indignation. He shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb. And the smoke of their torment ascends forever and ever; and they have no rest day or night, who worship the beast and his image, and whoever receives the mark of his name.” (Revelation 14:9-11).
People have been saying the end is coming for many years, but we need two key things. One, the Third Temple, and two, the technology for a cashless society to fulfill the prophecy of the Mark of the Beast.

Hey, how’s it going?
I want to pass along some very important news that everyone needs to hear!
In December of 2017, Donald Trump made history by recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Why is this big news? Because by this the Jewish people of Israel are now able to press forward in bringing about the Third Temple prophesied in the Bible.
Jewish Rabbis have publicly announced that their Messiah will be revealed in the coming years who will be a leader and spiritual guide to all nations, gathering all religions under the worship of one God.
Biblical prophecy tells us that this Jewish Messiah who will take the stage will be the antichrist “who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God or that is worshiped, so that he sits as God in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God” (2 Thessalonians 2:4). For a time he will bring about a false peace, but “Therefore when you see the ‘abomination of desolation,’ spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place (Matthew 24:15)…then there will be great tribulation, such as has not been since the beginning of the world until this time, no, nor ever shall be” (Matthew 24:21).
More importantly, the power that runs the world wants to put a RFID microchip in our body making us total slaves to them. This chip matches perfectly with the Mark of the Beast in the Bible, more specifically in Revelation 13:16-18:
“He causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, and that no one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.
Here is wisdom. Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man: His number is 666.”
Referring to the last days, this could only be speaking of a cashless society, which we have yet to see,  but are heading towards. Otherwise, we could still buy or sell without the mark amongst others if physical money was still currency. This Mark couldn’t be spiritual because the word references two different physical locations. If it was spiritual it would just say in the forehead. RFID microchip implant technology will be the future of a one world cashless society containing digital currency. It will be implanted in the right-hand or the forehead, and we cannot buy or sell without it. Revelation 13:11-18 tells us that a false prophet will arise on the world scene doing miracles before men, deceiving them to receive this Mark. Do not be deceived! We must grow strong in Jesus. AT ALL COSTS, DO NOT TAKE IT!
“Then a third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, “If anyone worships the beast and his image, and receives his mark on his forehead or on his hand, he himself shall also drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out full strength into the cup of His indignation. He shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb. And the smoke of their torment ascends forever and ever; and they have no rest day or night, who worship the beast and his image, and whoever receives the mark of his name” (Revelation 14:9-11).
People have been saying the end is coming for many years, but we needed two key things. One, the Third Temple, and two, the technology for a cashless society to fulfill the prophecy of the Mark of the Beast.
Visit http://WWW.BIBLEFREEDOM.COM to see proof for these things and why the Bible truly is the word of God!
If you haven’t already, it is time to seek God with all your heart. Jesus loves you more than you could imagine. He wants to have a relationship with you and redeem you from your sins. Turn to Him and repent while there is still hope! This is forever…God bless!
“EITHER HUMAN INTELLIGENCE ULTIMATELY OWES ITS ORIGIN TO MINDLESS MATTER OR THERE IS A CREATOR…” – JOHN LENNOX
We all know God exists. Why? Because without Him, we couldn’t prove anything at all. Do we live our lives as if we cannot know anything? No. So why is God necessary? In order to know anything for certain, you would have to know everything, or have revelation from somebody who does. Who is capable of knowing everything? God. So to know anything, you would have to be God, or know God.
A worldview without God cannot account for the uniformity and intelligibility of nature. And why is it that we can even reason that God is the best explanation for this if there is no God? We are given reason to know or reject God, but never to know that He does not exist.
It has been calculated by Roger Penrose that the odds of the initial conditions for the big bang to produce the universe that we see to be a number so big, that we could put a zero on every particle in the universe, and even that would not be enough to use every zero. What are the odds that God created the universe? Odds are no such thing. Who of you would gamble your life on one coin flip?
Is there evidence that the Bible is the truth? Yes. Did you know that the creation accounts listed in the book of Genesis are not only all correct, but are also in the correct chronological order? That the Bible doesn’t say the Earth was formed in six 24-hour days but rather six long but finite periods of time? That the Bible makes 10 times more creation claims than all major “holy” books combined with no contradictions, while these other books have errors in them? The Bible stood alone by concurring with the big bang saying, “In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth” (Genesis 1:1); and says our universe is expanding, thousands of years before scientists discovered these things. Watch a potential life-changing video on the website listed below with Astronomer(PhD) Hugh Ross explaining all these facts based on published scientific data. He has authored many books, backed even by atheist scientists.
Jesus came to pay a debt that we could not; to be our legal justifier to reconcile us back to a Holy God; only if we are willing to receive Him: “For the wages of sin is death…” (Romans 6:23).
God so loved the world that He gave us His only begotten son, so that whoever believes in Him, through faith, shall not perish, but have everlasting life. Jesus says if we wish to enter into life to keep the commands! The two greatest commands are to love God with all your heart, soul, strength, and mind; and your neighbor as yourself. All the law hang on these commands. We must be born of and lead by the Holy Spirit, to be called children of God, to inherit the kingdom. If we are willing to humble ourselves in prayer to Jesus, to confess and forsake our sins, He is willing to give the Holy Spirit to those who keep asking of Him; giving us a new heart, leading us into all truth!
Jesus came to free us from the bondage of sin. The everlasting fire was prepared for the devil and his angels due to disobedience to God’s law. If we do the same, what makes us any different than the devil? Jesus says unless we repent, we shall perish. For sin is the transgression of the law. We must walk in the Spirit so we may not fulfill the lusts of the flesh, being hatred, fornication, drunkenness and the like. Whoever practices such things will not inherit the kingdom (Galatians 5:16-26). If we sin, we may come before Jesus to ask for forgiveness (1 John 2:1-2). Evil thoughts are not sins, but rather temptations. It is not until these thoughts conceive and give birth by our own desires that they become sin (James 1:12-15). When we sin, we become in the likeness of the devil’s image, for he who sins     is of the devil (1 John 3:8); but if we obey Jesus, in the image of God. For without holiness, we shall not see the Lord (Hebrews 12:14).
The oldest religion in the world is holiness through faith (James 1:27). What religion did Adam and Eve follow before the fall? Jesus, Who became the last Adam, what religion does He follow? Is He not holy? He never told us to follow the rituals and traditions of man but to take up our cross and follow Him (Luke 9:23). There are many false doctrines being taught leading people astray. This is why we need the Holy Spirit for discernment. Unlike religion, holiness cannot be created. It is given to us from above by the baptism of the Spirit. Jesus is more than a religion; He is about having a personal relationship with the Father. Start by reading the Gospel of Matthew, to hear the words of God, to know His character and commandments. Follow and obey Jesus, for He is the way, the truth, and the life!

I’m new to the blog world but I’m trying to get
started and create my own. Do you require any coding expertise
to make your own blog? Any help would be greatly appreciated!

Have you ever thought about writing an e-book or guest authoring on other websites?
I have a blog based upon on the same ideas you discuss and would love to have you share some stories/information. I
know my viewers would enjoy your work. If you are even remotely
interested, feel free to shoot me an e-mail.
