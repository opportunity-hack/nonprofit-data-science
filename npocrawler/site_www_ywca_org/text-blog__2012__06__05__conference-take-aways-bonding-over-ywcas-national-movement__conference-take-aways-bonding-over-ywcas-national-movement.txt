Conference Take-Aways: Bonding Over YWCA’s National Movement

Job Developer, YWCA Greater Milwaukee 
Andrea Grant
I am both grateful and honored to have been sponsored to participate in the 2012 YWCA National Conference and Capitol Hill Day, themed “Shaking It Up.” This event was my first engagement with the national YWCA movement. I have worked for the YWCA Greater Milwaukee in Wisconsin since 2009, directly implementing services through our workforce development programs. Our day-to-day efforts to prepare our local workforce is challenging as there is a tremendous need, particularly in these difficult economic times. My attendance at the National Conference not only rejuvenated my passion for working with the YWCA but helped me learn who we are.
I gained a true sense of our lager identity, history and purpose at the conference. I also became aware of the organizational changes and the diversity of programs offered at local associations across the country.  Additionally, this trip to Washington, D.C., provided real opportunities to interact with strong female leaders and make a real impact.  The Women of Distinction Awards Gala event was inspirational and I am proud to participate in civic engagement at the national level by communicating directly to my legislators need for the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act to protect women in the state of Wisconsin.
Most importantly, this trip gave me the chance to really get to know the leaders from my local association in Milwaukee: Paula Penebaker, CEO; Ray Williams, board chair; and Shana Piaskoski, chief development officer. Throughout the conference I spent quality time with my colleagues Temacca McMurtry and Kadeitra Winters-Wallace creating an authentic personal bond.  Overall, I am more informed, connected and confident as an advocate for the YWCA. I hope that this effort to engage young women expands to future events. My experience is “priceless.”
Andrea Grant is proud to be a job developer at the YWCA Greater Milwaukee. She connects people to jobs by providing valuable workforce solutions to employers and advocacy for underserved job seekers. “I love my job with the YWCA because it aligns with my personal values,” says Grant. “It is always challenging and honestly there is never a dull moment. There is so much work to be done here in Milwaukee and I am proud to be involved in the creating real solutions.”
