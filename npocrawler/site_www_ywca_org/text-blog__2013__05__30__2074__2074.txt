What Women Want: A Blog Carnival for Immigration Reform
May 30, 2013

Tags: advocacy, comprehensive immigration reform, families, girls, immigration, racial justice, What Women Want blog carnival, women, women4CIR, ywca, ywca usa 



On June 6, 2013, we’re convening YWCA local associations, immigration reform activists and our national partners to call on Capitol Hill for the passage of comprehensive, common-sense reform with a focus on women, girls and immigrant communities. We’re calling it: “What Women Want: A National Day of Action for Immigration Reform.”
To get ready, read our What Women Want blog carnival, which focused on this question:
What do immigrant women need the most from comprehensive reform?
Check out the posts below, and if you have a post that you’d like to include, email Katie Stanton at kstanton@ywca.org or link to it in the comments below.

You really make it seem so easy with your presentation but I find this matter
to be actually something that I think I would never understand.
It seems too complicated and very broad for me. I am looking forward for your next post, I will
try to get the hang of it!

I do believe all the ideas you’ve offered to your post.
They’re really convincing and will certainly work. Still, the posts are too short for beginners.
May just you please prolong them a bit from subsequent time?
Thank you for the post.

I have been surfing online more than 3 hours today, yet I never found any interesting article like yours.
It’s pretty worth enough for me. Personally, if all web owners and bloggers
made good content as you did, the internet will be much more useful than ever before.

First of all I want to say terrific blog! I had a quick question which I’d like
to ask if you do not mind. I was interested to find out how you center yourself and clear your head before writing.
I’ve had a tough time clearing my thoughts in getting my thoughts out.
I truly do enjoy writing but it just seems like the first 10 to 15 minutes are usually wasted simply just trying to figure
out how to begin. Any recommendations or tips?
Kudos!

My coder is trying to persuade me to move to .net from PHP.
I have always disliked the idea because of the expenses.
But he’s tryiong none the less. I’ve been using WordPress on numerous websites for about a year and am nervous about switching
to another platform. I have heard excellent things about
blogengine.net. Is there a way I can import
all my wordpress content into it? Any kind of help would be greatly appreciated!
