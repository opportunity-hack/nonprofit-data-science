How YWCA’s “Stand Against Racism” Event Was Born
Thursday, April 26, 2012

by Judy Hutton CEO, YWCA Princeton, N.J. Even though the Stand Against Racism event began as a movement in April 2007, it was born in July of 2006. Two YWCA CEOs, twelve miles apart and very different, met over wine to get to get to know one another. Jose Hernandez was at his job at… Continue Reading How YWCA’s “Stand Against Racism” Event Was Born







Why is the U.S. Senate Playing Politics with Violence Against Women?
Tuesday, April 24, 2012

by Gloria Lau Chief Executive Officer, YWCA USA As an organization dedicated to improving the lives of all women and as the largest provider of battered women’s shelters and domestic violence services in the U.S., the YWCA is deeply disheartened by the increasing politicization of women’s health and safety by our elected officials.  As the… Continue Reading Why is the U.S. Senate Playing Politics with Violence Against Women?

Tuesday, April 17, 2012

by Kelli Owens Government Relations and Public Policy Director, YWCA Northeast Regional Council Today, April 17, is Pay Equity Day.  Discussions abound about how women have or have not cracked the glass ceiling and what’s being done to move low-income women from the sticky floor to self-sufficiency.

Thursday, April 5, 2012

by Mary Semela Director of Development, YWCA USA I am a white parent of young African-American men.

Stand Against Racism for Trayvon Martin
Tuesday, March 27, 2012

by Eileen Maloney-Simon CEO, YWCA Miami-Dade County Once again we find ourselves saddened, outraged, and questioning how a child can be killed at the hands of an adult.  Once again we find ourselves asking how this can happen, why did this happen, and how can we protect our children and guarantee them our country’s promise… Continue Reading Stand Against Racism for Trayvon Martin







Trayvon Martin: A Victim of Institutional Racism
Tuesday, March 27, 2012

by Lenice C. Emanuel CEO, YWCA Tampa Bay On February 26, in Sanford, Fla., Trayvon Martin, a black teenager, is believed to have been killed because of racial profiling. It is of little significance that the alleged perpetrator, George Zimmerman, considers himself a minority. It does, however, poignantly underscore the powerful and systemic implications of… Continue Reading Trayvon Martin: A Victim of Institutional Racism

Thursday, March 1, 2012

by Gloria Lau Chief Executive Officer, YWCA USA Today, the U.S. Senate voted 51-48 to defeat the amendment proposed by Senator Roy Blunt (R-MO) that sought to limit women’s ability to obtain contraception from their employers.  This narrow victory demonstrates just how partisan women’s health issues have become in this election season.  All Democratic Senators… Continue Reading Blunt Amendment is Defeated in Close Vote Along Mostly Partisan Lines – Can We Get the Politics Out of Women’s Health Care?







Women’s Health Becomes Political Football, Just as Women’s History Month Starts
Thursday, March 1, 2012

by Gloria Lau Chief Executive Officer, YWCA USA In this critical election year and as we mark the start of Women’s History Month today, it is hard to imagine that basic health care for women has become a political football.  In 2012.
