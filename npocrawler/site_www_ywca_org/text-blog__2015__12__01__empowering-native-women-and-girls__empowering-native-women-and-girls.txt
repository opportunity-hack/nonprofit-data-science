Empowering Native Women and Girls
December 1, 2015



by Kelsey Janway

Youth Ambassador, Center for Native American Youth
‚ÄúI raise up my voice‚Äînot so I can shout, but so that those without a voice can be heard‚Ä¶we cannot succeed when half of us are held back.‚Äù ?Malala Yousafzai 
The relevancy of this quote continues and will not soon shake. Being a young female itself can be difficult; being a young native female can be even more challenging. We‚Äôre constantly forced to believe we shouldn‚Äôt be in leadership positions; that we aren‚Äôt the face of strength and brilliance. Time and time again, we‚Äôre not taken seriously because of our gender.
As a result of this, women are discouraged and give up. As stated in the quote above, we will not function as successfully intended without partnership with others. I feel that it is so relevant to discover ourselves as inspiring women so that no one will be able to take our thoughts from us; that we will not be defeated. It has shown and will continue to show. We are strong, we are resilient, we are powerful.
If we don‚Äôt believe that about ourselves there is no way we can get others to believe that. We contain so many treasures, how dare anyone pass them up? We must listen to those people who can‚Äôt speak.
We must listen to our surroundings and peers. We must show them that we belong here just as much as anyone else. We must be able to compete. We must show our sisters that they are capable of earning the respect of others just like we are. We must be what we never had on our journey.
Melinda Gates captured it beautifully. ‚ÄúA woman with a voice is, by definition, a strong woman.‚Äù Just as prominent women from various nationalities in the past: we as native women will continue to leave our mark.
We will write a new story for women found within Indian country.

I spent four years trying EVERYTHING in Online Dating, and through a huge amount of trial and error, I produced a system that I will share for you. This book will take you, step by step, through everything you need to know to double, triple or even quadruple the number of women you meet online.

I travel all around the world for work, and it used to be really lonely. Now I can go onto Tinder and have a date lined up in a new city before I even get out of the airport!

Hi, I do believe this is an excellent blog. I stumbledupon it üòâ I may return yet again since I book-marked it. Money and freedom is the greatest way to change, may you be rich and continue to guide others.

Oh my goodness! Incredible article dude! Thanks, However I am going through difficulties with your RSS. I don‚Äôt understand why I cannot join it. Is there anyone else having identical RSS issues? Anybody who knows the answer can you kindly respond? Thanks!!

May I simply say what a relief to find somebody who really knows what they are discussing over the internet. You certainly know how to bring an issue to light and make it important. A lot more people really need to read this and understand this side of the story. I was surprised you‚Äôre not more popular given that you most certainly possess the gift.

A fascinating discussion is definitely worth comment. I do think that you should write more about this issue, it might not be a taboo subject but typically people don‚Äôt speak about these subjects. To the next! All the best!!

I absolutely love your site.. Very nice colors & theme. Did you make this amazing site yourself? Please reply back as I‚Äôm planning to create my own site and would like to find out where you got this from or exactly what the theme is named. Thank you!

Greetings, I do think your web site might be having internet browser compatibility problems. When I look at your site in Safari, it looks fine however when opening in I.E., it‚Äôs got some overlapping issues. I simply wanted to provide you with a quick heads up! Aside from that, wonderful blog!

I have been surfing on-line greater than 3 hours nowadays,
yet I by no means discovered any attention-grabbing article like yours.
It‚Äôs lovely worth sufficient for me. In my opinion,
if all website owners and bloggers made excellent content as you probably did,
the internet shall be a lot more helpful than ever before.
