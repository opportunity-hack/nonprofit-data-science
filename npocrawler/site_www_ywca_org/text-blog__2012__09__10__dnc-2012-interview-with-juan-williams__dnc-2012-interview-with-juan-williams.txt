DNC 2012: Video Interview with Juan Williams

YWCA’s Marianne Schild (right) with journalist Juan Williams at the 2012 Democratic National Convention
The last night of the Democratic National Convention, I got to spend a little time in one of the media boxes with journalist and political analyst Juan Williams.
I told him that for those of us in Generation Y the development of our political consciousness stems from wanting to elect officials, regardless of their party affiliation, to get a job done in a divisive political environment in which we are on rival teams.  I asked him, if this divisiveness is all we have ever known as a generation, how can we combat this?  Juan responded, “We must engage and fight it.”  Fight the urge to make fun of the other side.  Remember those are our politicians – we elected them, and they represent us.  As we change, they change.  Remember what President Clinton said Wednesday night:  their purpose is to make policies.  Elect them for their purpose to get things done, not because they are in your party.
I also asked Juan what he loves about YWCA.  His response might surprise you – watch the video below!
