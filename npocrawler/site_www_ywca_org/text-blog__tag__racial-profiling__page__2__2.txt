Take a Stand Against Hate Crimes
Thursday, October 18, 2012

by Qudsia Jafree YWCA USA It was nauseating to watch. A clip of a plane crashing into a tall building looped on the television in front of me, over and over again.

Tuesday, March 27, 2012

by Lenice C. Emanuel CEO, YWCA Tampa Bay On February 26, in Sanford, Fla., Trayvon Martin, a black teenager, is believed to have been killed because of racial profiling. It is of little significance that the alleged perpetrator, George Zimmerman, considers himself a minority. It does, however, poignantly underscore the powerful and systemic implications of… Continue Reading Trayvon Martin: A Victim of Institutional Racism
