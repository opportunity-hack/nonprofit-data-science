Keeping Children Safe from Domestic Violence
November 6, 2015



 

 
 
by Andrea Gadsen
Writer and Publisher
“Maybe when he looks at me he sees mommy.”
I pondered this thought over and over again in the midst of my own abuse as a child. Nothing else made sense.
I watched as my mother experienced violent rages from a man she had already divorced. Sometimes, my sister and I only heard the signs of a battle. A slap. A scream. A scuffle. Did he love her? And why did love sound so scary?
Eventually, he was banned from entering our home. But, he still had full visitation rights to my sister and me. And that’s when the target of his violence changed. I became the primary target as he began a multi-year pattern of sexual molestation.
I was too young to see the connection I now know. If my mother had known the possibility, she would have fought harder for no visitation rights. Studies indicate a strong overlap between domestic violence and sexual violence against children in the relationship; abusers are four to six times more likely to sexually abuse the children.
Researchers attribute the findings to the common themes of power and control, which both abusers and molesters exhibit. When the abuser lives in the home with the mother, he may use sexual violence against children as a way to exert total control over the family and create fear of retaliation. When the abuser does not live with the mother, sexual abuse against the child develops and/or escalates as a way to continue exerting power and control.
The effects of domestic violence on children often include emotional experiences of self-blame and sleeplessness, fear and anxiety, guilt and shame, anger and depression, isolation and vulnerability. Physical manifestations may include stomachaches, headaches or bedwetting. Children may have trouble focusing in school and may act out towards other children.
This list is not exhaustive, but it is interesting to find the effects of sexual abuse on a child similar to the effects of domestic violence. Children can experience depression, guilt, shame, self-blame, eating disorders, sleeping difficulty, anxiety, sexual and relationship problems, and disassociation. Thoughts of suicide are also part of the spectrum. In school, children may act out or become withdrawn.
This was my reality from my own abuse.
For the mother who knows she must leave an abusive relationship but has difficulty doing so, realizing the potential danger to her children may ignite the strength and courage to escape. Tools and support for leaving a harmful relationship exist through programs like the National Domestic Violence Hotline.
Looking back on my own story, I was partially blessed. When my mother discovered my father was sexually abusing me, she used all the resources available at the time to remove me from the relationship and to seek his prosecution.
It was an additional huge measure of fight for a woman who had already been battling through divorce and independence. However, the damage had already taken hold. Some of the emotional and physical aspects I describe earlier would become part of my makeup. It took a number of years to begin healing.
So what about your children? If you are in abusive relationship, ask yourself if they are safe. Children experience a host of emotional, psychological, and physical reactions which may take years to overcome. No child needs to have this experience.

Howdy, I do believe your site could be having internet browser compatibility issues.
Whenever I look at your site in Safari, it looks fine
however, when opening in Internet Explorer, it’s got some overlapping issues.
I just wanted to give you a quick heads up!
Aside from that, fantastic site!
