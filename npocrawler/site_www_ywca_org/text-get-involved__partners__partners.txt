Centene believes that quality healthcare should focus on the individual and address all facets of a person’s well-being, including environmental and socioeconomic factors.
With that goal, YWCA USA and Centene Corporation engaged in a three-year project to launch Young Women Choosing Action, an emotional management and healthy relationships program for teen girls served through YWCA’s network. Funded by a grant from The Centene Charitable Foundation, Young Women Choosing Action is an intersectional and culturally responsive program designed with the needs of low-income young women and women of color in mind. Throughout 13 facilitated sessions, teens with varying experiences with trauma, stress, and structural inequities develop leadership skills, expand their understanding of their responses to trauma, cultivate a practice of personal well-being, and ultimately build their capacity as leaders

USA Track and Field

As an extension of our national Health & Safety platform, YWCA USA has adopted RunJumpThrow (RJT) as a model program. RJT, a program of USA Track and Field (USATF), is a hands-on curriculum designed to introduce children to basic skills of running, jumping and throwing — skills that are essential to physical literacy and building life-long habits of and access to physical activity. This partnership helps YWCA USA positively impact the lives of children, especially those who are traditionally underserved, have the least access to structured and unstructured play, and are likely to have inequitable health outcomes. As a model program, YWCA USA has partnered with USATF to customize a RJT curriculum that specifically focuses on how RJT aligns with one of our national outcomes: to improve the health of women and girls of color.
