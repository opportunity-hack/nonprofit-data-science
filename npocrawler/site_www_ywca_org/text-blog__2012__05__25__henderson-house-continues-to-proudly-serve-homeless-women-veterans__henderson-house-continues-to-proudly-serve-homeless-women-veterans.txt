Henderson House Continues to Proudly Serve Homeless Women Veterans

In May 2011, the YWCA Middle Rio Grande in Albuquerque, New Mexico started Henderson House, which is a transitional housing program for women veterans and their children who are experiencing homelessness. Henderson House, which is funded by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), foundations, companies and individuals, can serve 10 women and their children at any given time. The program is designed so that 80% will go on to permanent housing within 1 year and then other women will take their place. Our experience with Henderson House has shown that women veterans and their children can succeed when they have a safe, affordable housing and the supports and services they need to maintain that housing.
Unfortunately, the issue of homelessness among women veterans and their children is growing, as more women return from the active duty in Afghanistan and Iraq. The Government Accountability Office estimated that the ranks of homeless female veterans had risen more than 140 percent between 2006 and 2010. While the transition from military to civilian life is a difficult adjustment for both male and female veterans, it is especially difficult for women. For many, having a safe, gender-specific facility where their children can also live is essential to their recovery. Research suggests that 81-93% of female veterans have been exposed to some type of trauma both before and after enlistment. Traumatic experiences include childhood abuse and neglect, domestic violence, post-traumatic stress disorder and military sexual trauma. These experiences have a significant impact on mental and physical health, family relationships, and housing and job stability. As the VA and our communities strive to end homelessness among veterans, we must remember that women veterans experience homelessness too.

This is a wonderful facility and important service that indeed should be a model for other transitional programs.  The YWCA Middle Rio Grande should be proud of the success of “Vet V” and the many women veterans served and supported by the Henderson House.  Congratulations!

Domestic violence/abuse  has robbed my three small children and I of just about everything we are and who we once knew us to be!  I was a head strong, focused, and motivated mother taking each minute objectively ; bound and determined to finish school start a career, and be actively involved with my children and their affairs.  I had a vision, goals, and mapped out a plan towards establishing a successful, stable, and secure home and lifestyle to raise and provide my family….
                                                                               To be continued…

Its such as you learn my mind! You appear to understand a lot
about this, such as you wrote the book in it or something.
I believe that you just could do with a few p.c. to force the message house
a little bit, however other than that, this is magnificent blog.
An excellent read. I will definitely be back.

Hey just wanted to give you a quick heads up. The words in your article seem to be running off the screen in Safari.
I’m not sure if this is a format issue or something to do with web browser compatibility but I figured I’d post
to let you know. The layout look great though! Hope you get the issue solved
soon. Thanks
