Rochester‚Äôs History of Strong Women Continues Today

By Jean Carroll, President & CEO
 YWCA Rochester & Monroe County
Jean Carroll
March is designated as ‚ÄúWomen‚Äôs History Month,‚Äù and I‚Äôm honored to live and work in a city that has such a rich history of strong, powerful, influential women. Rochester, New York is where Susan B. Anthony lived, worked and campaigned for women‚Äôs rights.
In 1872, Anthony and several other women voted (illegally at the time) in the Presidential election. She was found guilty and ordered to pay a $100 fine (which she never paid). 14 years after she died, women were granted the right to vote with the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment. The goal of equality and empowerment for all women continues today, and a recent poverty report issued about Rochester shows we have a long way to go.
The poverty report, issued by the Rochester Area Community Foundation, showed that Rochester is the fifth poorest city in the country. The statistics get worse when you look at women of color, worse for female-headed families, and worse yet for female-headed families with children under the age of five. Our YWCA Housing and Teen Services programs get to see first-hand how the issues of poverty, race, education and housing disproportionately affect women. But I‚Äôve also seen how, with just a little bit of support and help, women can accomplish amazing things!
Each year the YWCA hosts an event called the Empowering Women Luncheon. We invite speakers to come and share their stories of overcoming adversity and what it took to empower themselves to do better. In addition to these keynote speakers, we invite participants from our Housing and Teen Services programs to share their stories. The most moving and inspiring stories often come from the women we serve. Incredible stories, like the one told by Safari from our Teen Services program, who faced an abusive household, the sudden death of her sister and then became pregnant at 14 years old. Case workers from our Teen Services program provided support and guidance for her and she‚Äôs graduating this spring from high school and making plans for college.
A YWCA resident named Dellenna also shared her story at the luncheon about her journey. She arrived at the YWCA a recovering addict who had spent most of the past decade on the streets until she went to jail. She stayed at the YWCA two years, earned her Master‚Äôs Degree this past May, and is now the director of a prison outreach program here in Rochester. She told me, ‚ÄúI came here on my knees and I left standing, walking. I‚Äôm fully self-sufficient. I love the woman I am today.‚Äù
I think Susan B. Anthony would like her too.
Jean Carroll has been with the YWCA of Rochester and Monroe County since 1985, as its controller. She became the President and CEO in 1995. She is known for her strategic planning skills and her passion to improve the lives of women and girls, especially those facing personal challenges such as homelessness, domestic violence, substance abuse or teen pregnancy.¬†

Indeed, Rochester does have a history of strong women including the women in my family.  My great aunt, Helen A Davis went to work for the YWCA in Rochester right after they built their first gym.  In 1904 she became the Secretary General of the Rochester YWCA.  In 1909, she moved on to the national Y in NYC where she was director of Field Work, War Work during WWI and eventually became Associate General Secretary.
I have been to Rochester several times to do research with the Y archives in the Rare Book Collection at the Univ of Rochester.  While there, 3 years ago, I was able to attend one of your Empowering Women luncheons.  I have also been doing research using the National Y archives at Smith College.
The YWCA history in incredible!!!
My mother and my sister, Francie Garber Pepper, have been very active with the YWCA in Cincinnati.
