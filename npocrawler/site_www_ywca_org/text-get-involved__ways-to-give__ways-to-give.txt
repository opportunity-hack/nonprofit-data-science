Ways To Give
YWCA is on a mission to eliminate racism and empower women. We’ve been at the forefront of the biggest issues of the day for 160 years, and with your support we can continue working to improve the lives of girls and women for years to come. There are a number of ways for you to support YWCA, including secure online giving through the form below, sponsorship, making a gift of stocks, bonds or mutual funds, donating your vehicle, contributing to YWCA through Amazon Smile, planned giving or mailing a check. For online donations you can select your preferred frequency of donation (one-time, monthly, annually) and whether your gift goes to your local affiliation, bolsters our national-level work or supports YWCA global. Thank you for giving what you can! Your support in any form or amount is integral to helping advance our mission.

YWCA USA is on a mission to eliminate racism, empower women, stand up for social justice, help families, and strengthen communities. For over 160 years we’ve been at the forefront of the most pressing social movements — from voting rights to civil rights, from affordable housing to pay equity, from violence prevention to health care reform. We combine programming and advocacy in order to generate institutional change in three key areas: racial justice and civil rights, empowerment and economic advancement and health and safety of women and girls.
Your donation to YWCA USA will strengthen our support for associations around the country and fund robust advocacy efforts to educate and partner with lawmakers on policies that advance our critical mission of eliminating racism and empowering women.
Donate to YWCA USA


YWCA has over 200 local associations all over the United States. These local associations are the heart of our organization and move the needle on eliminating racism and empowering women every day by meeting needs in their communities. From running emergency shelters to holding candidate forums on racial profiling and the criminalization of girls and women of color, YWCA local associations are putting our mission into action around the country.
Thank you for choosing to support a local YWCA. Your support is critical for the programs and services that local YWCAs provide in their communities!
Donate to your local YWCA


The World Service Council is comprised of women with a global vision who care about our changing world and champion the work of the YWCA USA and World YWCA. Being a member is a way for YWCA volunteers and staff from local associations to continue and expand their service to the broader movement, and for women new to the YWCA to join, learn and help increase the status of women around the world. It is the official philanthropic arm of YWCA USA that raises funds for the World YWCA and its 122 country affiliates while advocating for justice, peach, health, human rights, gender equality and a sustainable development.
World Service Council Priorities Include:

To raise significant funds and provide volunteer resources for the World YWCA, the International Building Fund and the YWCA USA as a Council to the YWCA Global Relations Committee.
To inform members of social, political and economic forces affecting women and their opportunities for growth and development.
To communicate and follow international issues through the World YWCA and World Service Council website, reports and newsletters from the World YWCA, YWCA USA, Global Relations Committee and YWCA publications.
To provide in-person meeting opportunities including an annual business meeting, luncheon and seminar at interesting locations with distinguished speakers.
To assist in sponsoring a reception with YWCA USA for the World YWCA delegates attending the annual UN’s Commission on the Status of Women hearings.
To participate in YWCA USA meetings, seminars and leadership events.
To attend relevant national and international conferences and workshops.
To provide hospitality to visiting World YWCA leaders and dignitaries.
