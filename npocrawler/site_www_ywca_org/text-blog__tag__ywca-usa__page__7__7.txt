Wednesday, June 6, 2012

by Gloria Lau, YWCA CEO Yesterday, 52 U.S. Senators voted in favor of the Paycheck Fairness Act.  While a majority, it was still eight votes shy of the number needed to move this gender equity bill forward. I couldn’t help but note the parallel to women and power. We are a majority in the U.S.,… Continue Reading Senate Fails to Pass Paycheck Fairness Act: Yet Another Example of the Politicization of Women’s Issues
