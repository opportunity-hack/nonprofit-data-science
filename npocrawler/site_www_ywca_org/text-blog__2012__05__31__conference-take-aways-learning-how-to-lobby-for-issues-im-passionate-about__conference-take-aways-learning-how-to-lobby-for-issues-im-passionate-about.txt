Conference Take-Aways: Learning How to Lobby for Issues I’m Passionate About

At the YWCA National Conference, I learned how to lobby for issues that I am passionate about. This is a skill/act that I have never performed before. Women in persimmon from all around the U.S. came to Washington, D.C., and were passionate about the same issues that affect women and girls. And as a group, we fought for them.
Meeting with Congressional staff during Capitol Hill Day was a great experience. I was surprised to see that I went to college with some of the staff that I met with. This helped to ease the transition and made them more adamant about hearing what I had to say. One staffer said to me, “How long have you been doing this? You’re really good at it.”
Also, at the conference I met other young executives that are facing some of the same challenges as I am. It helped me to see that I’m not the only one facing these issues – regardless of the size of my organization.
Tiffany Salgado is executive director of the YWCA Greater Johnstown in Pennsylvania. She holds a Master of Arts in Industrial and Organizational Psychology and a Bachelor of Science in Psychology and Business Management.

Dear Ms. Salgado,
Your collective education and skills are quite impressive.  I am replying to you because I am very proud to be a member of Johnstown YWCA and empathetic and passionate its many causes.  
Although I am gainfully employed in healthcare, writing and old architecture encompass my passion.  In fact, I wrote something for the YWCA of Johnstown which was shared, I believe, on facebook.  It was entitled “Transcended.”  I hope you enjoy it, and thank you, for being you.
