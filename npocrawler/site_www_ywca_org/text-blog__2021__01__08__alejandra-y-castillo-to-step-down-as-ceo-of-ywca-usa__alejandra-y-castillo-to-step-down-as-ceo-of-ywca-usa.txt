Today, YWCA USA announced Alejandra Y. Castillo will step down as CEO on March 31, 2021. The YWCA USA Board of Directors will launch a national search for a new CEO to lead the organization in its pursuit of racial justice, gender equity, and help strengthen its national network of local YWCA’s, which provide direct services to more than 2 million women, girls, and their families in over 1,200 communities across the United States. As the nation grapples with COVID-19 and the ensuing economic crisis that has disproportionately affected the communities we serve, we embark on this search with urgency and excitement.
Alejandra Y. Castillo served as CEO for more than three years. During her tenure, YWCA USA and its network of 200 Associations gained greater recognition for their stance against racism, sexism, and their work to create a world where all women and girls experience justice and equity. She also led YWCA USA through a period of strengthened national fundraising efforts and introduced new ways to support the operations of local associations affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Statement from N. Elizabeth McCaw, Chair, YWCA USA Board of Directors:
“Alejandra’s contributions to advancing the mission of the YWCA are many, and we are grateful for the leadership, advocacy, and energy she brought to the national movement to eliminate racism and empower women. Because of Alejandra’s leadership and strategic vision, YWCA is well positioned to continue doing the work we’ve done for more than a century: strengthening communities and families and fighting for women and racial justice.”
Statement from Alejandra Y. Castillo:
“YWCA USA has been a trusted partner in communities across this country for more than 160 years, and I will be leaving the organization well-positioned to continue that critical work. I will continue to support YWCA’s mission of eliminating racism and empowering women and will march alongside them in the fight for justice, families, and women. Leading YWCA USA has been an honor, and I’m deeply proud of all that we accomplished together.”
About YWCA USA 
YWCA USA is on a mission to eliminate racism, empower women, and promote peace, justice, freedom and dignity for all. The organization is one of the oldest and largest women’s organizations in the nation, serving over two million women, girls, and their families each year. Learn more: www.ywca.org.
