Take Action:  Tell Your Senator to Pass the Minimum Wage Fairness Act!
April 30, 2014

Tags: action, alert, congress, economy, fairness, federal minimum wage, minimum wage, people of color, Senate, tipped wages, women, workers 



By Danielle Marse-KaprSenior Advocacy and Policy Associate,¬†Economic Empowerment

Every year that Congress fails to increase the federal minimum wage, the value of the minimum wage declines considerably, driving more families into poverty. This is why it‚Äôs critical that the Senate brings the Minimum Wage Fairness Act (S. 2223) to a vote today and passes the bill!¬†
The Minimum Wage Fairness Act would increase the minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10 and raise the tipped minimum wage up from $2.13 per hour. This would give more than 30 million workers a raise ‚Äì more than half of them women. People of color are also over-represented in minimum wage jobs, as they represent 42% of those earners, even though they make up 32% of the workforce. Increasing the minimum wage would boost wages for millions of women and help close the wage gap.
The Senate plans to vote on the Minimum Wage Fairness Act (S. 2223) today, so reach out to your Senator now and tell them to raise the minimum wage. No one who works full time should live in poverty. Raising the minimum wage is an issue of¬†fairness and equality.
Take action now! Contact your Senator today and tell them to pass the Minimum Wage Fairness Act.¬†

The crux of your writing while sounding reasonable at first, did not settle very well with me personally after some time. Somewhere within the sentences you actually were able to make me a believer unfortunately just for a while. I still have got a problem with your jumps in logic and one would do nicely to fill in all those gaps. When you actually can accomplish that, I would definitely be impressed.
