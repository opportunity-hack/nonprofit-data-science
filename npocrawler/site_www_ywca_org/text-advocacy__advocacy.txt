Advocacy
YWCA is on a mission to eliminate racism, empower women, stand up for social justice, help families and strengthen communities. We’ve been at the forefront of the biggest issues of the day for 160 years: from voting rights to civil rights, from affordable housing to pay equity and from violence prevention to health care reform. We carry on this long tradition of social action and advocacy to advance our mission — and you are a crucial part of this work. Your voice is critical as we advocate for policies that bring us closer to eliminating racism, empowering women, and ensuring peace, justice, freedom and dignity for all.
