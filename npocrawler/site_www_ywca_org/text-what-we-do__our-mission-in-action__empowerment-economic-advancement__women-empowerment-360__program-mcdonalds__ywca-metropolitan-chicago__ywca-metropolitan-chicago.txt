YWCA Metropolitan Chicago
While it may appear to be easy to start a business, an American Express report stated “88% of small businesses do not make more than $100,000.”
YWCA is hoping to change this statistic by offering mentoring, business leadership skills and access to funding to our community entrepreneurs. Register for a multi-week course based on the GUIDED Business Plan™ training series written by Melanie Rae. You will receive clear instructions to build a better business.
What you can expect to learn:

The who, what, where, why and how of your business idea – will it make the money you want to earn?
Who may be the easiest customer who will say YES to you
How you can introduce your product or service to those who will pay what you’re asking for
How to launch, operate and finance your business
Introductory business terms so you can build your confidence as a business owner

What is included:

Printed GUIDED Business Plan™ book — an on-the-go tool to organize your ideas to generate sales
GUIDED Budget – a free, easy to use spreadsheet to determine how much your business could make
GBP Style Sheet – a free document to format your business plan to present to lenders, family, friends and other stakeholders
Personalized advice as you write your plan in class PLUS one-on-one consulting
Inspiration from others in your community who are growing a small business

Who this course is for:

Aspiring or budding entrepreneurs
Main street and “mom & pop” businesses
Part-timers – farmers market vendors, online sellers
Small businesses and job creators
Full-time employees looking to start a business

Will occur in 2020 – may tentatively move to 2019
