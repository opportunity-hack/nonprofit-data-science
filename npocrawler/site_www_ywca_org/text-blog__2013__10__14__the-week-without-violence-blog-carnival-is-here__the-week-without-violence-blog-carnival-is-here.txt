The Week Without Violence Blog Carnival is Here!
October 14, 2013

Tags: #ywcaWWV, blog carnival, end violence, families, girls, violence, Week Without Violence, ywca 



By Katie Stanton 
Social Media & Online Engagement Manager, YWCA USA
The YWCA Week Without Violence™, held annually every third week in October, is a signature initiative created by YWCA USA nearly 20 years ago to mobilize people in communities across the United States to take action against all forms of violence, wherever it occurs. Each year, YWCAs all around the country host local Week Without Violence™ events and create a public dialogue about violence, in all of its forms.
For our blog carnival this year, we asked: What will it take to end violence against women and girls?
Women and girls can face interlocking barriers, such as sexism and racism, which play integral roles in our understanding and awareness of how and why violence is propagated. The question for many on the front lines becomes: how can we more effectively encourage our communities to help put an end to all forms of violence, while considering the influence of systems like racism and sexism? How can we, as communities and as a larger society, work to change our culture of violence – whether it is through the language we use, the cultural values and social norms we find ourselves adhering to, or the sort of news that gets widely covered?

October 14: Domestic Violence 
“Despite the incredible work local nonprofits and shelters do on a daily basis to provide victims of violence resources and services, nearly 10,500 requests for services per day go by unmet.”
October 15: Sexual Assault
“According to a 2013 report by the National Alliance to End Sexual Assault (NAESV), over 1.3 million women are raped each year in the U.S., with 1 out of every 5 women experiencing attempted or completed rape.”
October 16: Hate Crimes
“Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Justice and the FBI announced that it would begin tracking hate crimes against 7 new subgroups: Sikhs, Hindus, Arabs, Mormons, Buddhists, Jehovah’s Witnesses and Orthodox Christians.”
October 17: Racial Profiling
“As one of the oldest and largest women’s rights organizations in the United States, the YWCA is particularly committed to ensuring that immigration reform legislation is inclusive of provisions that protect and understand the unique challenges that immigrant women and families experience.”
October 18: Sexual Trafficking
“According to the United Nations, an estimated 700,000 – 2 million women are trafficked across international borders annually. If you take into account rates of trafficking within the United States, that number looks a lot larger, at nearly 4 million women per year.”
