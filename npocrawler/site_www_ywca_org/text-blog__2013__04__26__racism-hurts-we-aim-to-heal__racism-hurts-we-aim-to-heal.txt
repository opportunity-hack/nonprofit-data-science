Racism Hurts; We Aim to Heal

By Ashley Burton, Marketing Manager
YWCA of Winston-Salem 
The YWCA of Winston-Salem was founded in 1908 by a handful of God-fearing women who had a vision for their city. In a time when segregation and social injustice was highly prevalent, these women wanted to declare a peaceful haven for all — regardless of race, color, or creed.
In order for racism to no longer exist, we have to adopt this kind of fearless thinking, as these founding women did. I can imagine them facing ridicule and scorn from members of their society, but they pushed forward, fulfilling their passion for equality and justice.
The United States truly is a “melting pot,” a place that protects freedom and promotes an evolving culture. If we were able to see every person as an ingredient in the “melting pot” of America that enhances the flavor of other ingredients, we could become one step closer to appreciating all cultures of the people who call America home.

The YWCA of Winston-Salem, like the YWCA overall, is dedicated to eliminating racism in all forms. We aim to serve each member in our community and specialize in making everyone feel welcome and comfortable. We promote programs like “Sisters with Voices,” an open forum group that allows members to speak out about racism and personal experiences, as well as break through stereotypes to promote equality. We encourage our members and the community to be accepting of everyone, and to invite anyone who may need to connect with others in an open and accepting environment. You will feel welcomed here!
Learn more about the YWCA Winston-Salem and their programs, and visit them on Facebook and Twitter. 
Ashley Burton is a native of Winston-Salem, N.C. and is the Marketing Manager for the YWCA of Winston-Salem.  She received her degree in Communication from Salem College. In her spare time, she enjoys playing with her three children, and doing Zumba. “I look forward to coming to work every day. Knowing that I am serving my community through our mission is a powerful feeling,” she says about working for the YWCA!
This post is part of the YWCA USA Stand Against Racism blog carnival on issues of race, justice and diversity. We invite you to join the dialogue! Post your comment below, share your story and follow the conversation on Twitter with the hashtag #StandAgainstRacism.

Definitely believe that which you said. Your favorite
justification seemed to be on the internet the easiest
thing to be aware of. I say to you, I certainly get irked while
people think about worries that they plainly don’t know about.
You managed to hit the nail upon the top as well as defined
out the whole thing without having side effect , people can take a signal.
Will probably be back to get more. Thanks
