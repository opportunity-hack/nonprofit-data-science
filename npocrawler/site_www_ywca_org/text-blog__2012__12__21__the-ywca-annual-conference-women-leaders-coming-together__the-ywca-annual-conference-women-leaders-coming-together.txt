By De’Kendrea Stamps
 YWCA of Madison, Wisc.
Janet Marcotte, YWCA Tucson Executive Director, presented the 2012 YWCA USA Women of Distinction Award for Civic Engagement in honor of Gabrielle Giffords to her mother, Gloria Giffords. May 4, 2012 in Washington, D.C.
The Annual Conference is a time to build strong bonds with your colleagues from other YWCAs and to learn best practices from YWCA staff and workshop leaders. I had many favorite moments from the 2012 YWCA Annual Conference. One was seeing Gabrielle Giffords’ mother, Gloria, accept the Women of Distinction Award for civic engagement on behalf of her daughter. To hear a mother speak so sincerely about her daughter and her accomplishments in the face of tragedy was very touching. Another highlight was a valuable workshop session that provided me with a new perspective on women with ambitions to be elected to leadership positions in government. It offered a realistic view of the components that go into building a successful campaign and was eye-opening and very intriguing. And, the experience of meeting with our Congressional legislators was very empowering. I would love to see that sea of YWCA persimmon marching up Capitol Hill again.

At the Conference, I realized that we all are working collectively to help empower women — for example, so many YWCA’s provide housing, counseling, transportation or childcare to help people secure employment. This empowers families economically and strengthens the family unit. However, each local association delivers different or tailored services depending on the communities we serve and our own local experiences. The YWCA is effectively providing customized, systemic change and support to our communities every day. The very thought of this blows my mind and gives me so much pride in the work that I do to support our mission in my community.
At the next Conference in June, I am looking forward to comparing the changing demographics of our service areas with other YWCA staff from across the United States, and learning new approaches about how the programs we offer can evolve to keep up with the times and the needs of the growing segments of those we serve. Young women, in addition to taking full advantage of the workshops and networking with their peers, should also use the conference as a time to talk to and learn from the more experienced women who have been committed to doing the work of the YWCA throughout their careers. On the whole, I encourage my YWCA colleagues to attend the Annual Conference in 2013 in Washington, DC — it is an opportunity for us all to forge new relationships with and to learn from fellow leaders.
De’Kendrea Stamps is the Director of YW Transit at the YWCA of Madison, Wisconsin. She started working for YW Transit in August of 2009 and became Director in June, 2012. YW Transit provides 24 hour/7 day specialized transportation throughout Dane county to women, men and children for employment related, sexual assault prevention/domestic violence intervention, and contracted transportation purposes. De’Kendrea has over 15 years of work and volunteer experience in the governmental and non-profit sectors, and has served on various city committees, steering councils, and planning teams.

At this time it looks like Drupal is the best blogging platform available right now.
(from what I’ve read) Is that what you’re using on your blog?

having side-effects , people can take a signal. Will probably be back
to get more. Thanks

Hey there superb website! Does running a blog like this require a
lot of work? I have no knowledge of computer programming however I was hoping to start my own blog in the near future.
Anyways, if you have any ideas or techniques for new
blog owners please share. I know this is off subject nevertheless I just needed to ask.

Hi there just wanted to give you a quick heads up and let you
know a few of the pictures aren’t loading correctly.
I’m not sure why but I think its a linking issue. I’ve tried it in two different
web browsers and both show the same outcome.

Appreciating the persistence you put into your website and in depth information you present.
It’s good to come across a blog every once in a while
that isn’t the same outdated rehashed information. Great
read! I’ve saved your site and I’m including your RSS feeds
to my Google account.

When I initially commented I appear to have clicked the -Notify me when new
comments are added- checkbox and from now on whenever a
comment is added I receive 4 emails with the exact same comment.
Perhaps there is an easy method you are able to remove me from that service?
Thanks!

I know this if off topic but I’m looking into starting my own weblog and was
wondering what all is needed to get setup? I’m assuming having
a blog like yours would cost a pretty penny? I’m not very internet smart so I’m not 100% certain. Any tips or
advice would be greatly appreciated. Cheers

Hi there! I could have sworn I’ve been to this website before
but after looking at a few of the articles I realized it’s new to me.
Regardless, I’m definitely pleased I stumbled upon it and I’ll be bookmarking it and checking
back often!

Its like you read my mind! You seem to know so much about this,
like you wrote the book in it or something. I think that you could do with a few pics to drive
the message home a little bit, but instead of that, this is magnificent blog.
An excellent read. I’ll definitely be back.

Right now it looks like Expression Engine is the top blogging platform out there right now.
(from what I’ve read) Is that what you’re using on your blog?

Hello there! Quick question that’s entirely off topic. Do you know how to
make your site mobile friendly? My site looks weird when browsing from my iphone4.
I’m trying to find a theme or plugin that might be able to fix this problem.
If you have any suggestions, please share. Appreciate it!

A fascinating discussion is worth comment. I do think that you need to write more about
this subject matter, it may not be a taboo subject
but typically people do not discuss these issues.
To the next! Many thanks!!
