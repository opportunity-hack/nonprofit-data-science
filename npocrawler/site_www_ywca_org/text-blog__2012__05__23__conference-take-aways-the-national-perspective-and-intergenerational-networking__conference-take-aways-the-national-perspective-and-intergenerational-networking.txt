Conference Take-Aways: The National Perspective and Intergenerational Networking

I thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity to see the YWCA on a national level at the 2012 National Conference. While working every day in the field sometimes it becomes harder to conceptualize the big picture. Being able to network and share experiences with others allowed me the chance to understand how all of our individual efforts move the organization towards the common goal of empowering women and eliminating racism. Often when speaking with professionals in other fields it is hard for them to see how things as basic as housing, counseling, transportation, or childcare can have such a huge impact on societal outcomes, however being around others that share the same goals is very empowering.
Being able to share not only with young women in the organization, but also with those who have been at this work for decades was an honor. There was an ease of conversation with everyone I encountered. I have been in situations before where I may have been the youngest person in the room, the only woman or minority and felt like my voice was not considered, but during my time at the conference I never felt that way. For me, the greatest value-add from the conference was being able to hear stories and ask question about how this work has impacted your life and your ability to be deliberate about forging a career that is not only fulfilling, but also works to help others. That’s the kind of legacy I have always wanted to be associated with, the kind of legacy I work hard every day to do my part in upholding.

Having read this I believed it was very enlightening.
I appreciate you spending some time and effort to put this content together.
I once again find myself spending way too much time both reading
and commenting. But so what, it was still worthwhile!

Heya terrific website! Does running a blog similar to this require a lot of work?
I have virtually no expertise in computer programming however I was hoping to start my own blog in the near future.
Anyways, should you have any ideas or tips for new blog owners
please share. I know this is off topic nevertheless I just needed to ask.
Thanks!

When I initially commented I clicked the “Notify me when new comments are added” checkbox and now each time a comment is added I get several
e-mails with the same comment. Is there any way you
can remove people from that service? Thank you!
