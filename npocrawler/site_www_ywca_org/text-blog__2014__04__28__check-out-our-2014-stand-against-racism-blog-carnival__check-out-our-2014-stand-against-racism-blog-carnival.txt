April 28, 2014



By Katie Stanton
YWCA USA Social Media Manager
Eliminating racism is at the center of the YWCA‚Äôs mission. That‚Äôs why each year local associations participate in¬†Stand Against Racism, a campaign and ongoing public conversation about race and equality.
In support of this nationwide campaign, the YWCA USA was¬†proud to convene our blog carnival for¬†Stand Against Racism.¬†Racial justice is an¬†integral and defining part¬†of the work of the YWCA.¬†Stand Against Racism¬†is a signature event that furthers our mission to eliminate racism and empower women across the country.
This year, we asked:¬†How are the lives of women impacted by racism?

Against Racism Blog Carnival ‚Äì YWCA USA is kinda
boring. You could glance at Yahoo‚Äôs front page and note how they write news headlines to grab people interested.
You might try adding a video or a picture or two to get readers interested about
what you‚Äôve written. Just my opinion, it could make your posts a little bit more interesting.

A general contractor is the person responsible for the renovation and demolition of roads, freeways and buildings.
Months before the decision to market the house is done, the homeowner must
have a look at their own property, both in and out, over the eyes of an potential
buyer.  Sometimes they will also be able to
create the logo for a favored team on top of the court as well.

A general contractor may be the person in charge of the renovation and demolition of roads, freeways and buildings.
It is also far better to buy an electrical or battery

make you many websites focusing on steel buildings for sale.

The Positive Effects of Reiki about the Human Body
Reiki is recognized for its positive results on the human body.
However, a lot of people of those that never have yet experienced its power determine what exactly Reiki does and what its benefits are.
If you are interested in the way Reiki can help you, then please read on and discover
what Reiki are capable of doing for your body, mind and soul.
1. Increases one‚Äôs body‚Äôs ability to heal itself.
Normally, the body includes a defense system which functions good as long as the Ki flow
is just not interrupted. When the Ki has stopped being able to flow through our bodies,
illnesses and diseases can be displayed. Reiki stimulates the flow of positive energy, thus enabling your
body to heal itself and fight the internal and external attacks more efficiently.
2. Cleans your body of all toxins. Because it acts around the human body, it is one
of the few complete detox programs one can possibly follow.
In addition to that it does not involve refraining from food
or other sort of activity. Yet, negative
thoughts should be banned in the individual‚Äôs mind since they will have a negative impact upon the therapy.
3. Promotes health, positive thoughts and relaxation. The principles of Reiki depend upon positive thinking,
thus a reassurance and relaxation is induced towards
the individual. By removing negative energy and promoting a sense peace, the process of recovery is going to be easier and shorter,
whatever the illness or disease that the individual suffers.
4. Works around the digestive tract and enhances the benefic effects
of anything a person ingests, from food and water to medicines and curative herbs.
Thus, it could be proven to work as a complementary therapy for anyone already taking medicine, but at the same time it can be ideal for maintain the individual‚Äôs health
in good parameters.
5. Works on personal feelings, helping people conquer negative experiences using their lives and
dealing with unexpected or unpleasant situations off their lives.
People with depressions, anxieties or experiencing stress are able to
see dramatic improvements of their conditions following the Reiki sessions.
6. Makes the transition from life to death easier.
It helps the soul transcend into immortality and
your body feel less experiencing this transformation. This
is why many Reiki adepts make use of the Ki to generate their transition derived from one of world to a new smoother.
Reiki offers healing for all forms of bodily conditions, and for the
spiritual problems. It is like a best ally
for many those people short of funds, nonetheless it may
also relieve healthy people from quotidian stress and problems.

Whilst there are several movers in certain of the key US metropolitan areas like Pahrump and Las Vegas, you should realize
that they serve various functions.  As part of this bill, lenders have to be to blame for
upkeep of these vacant properties. This trend
is nott just benefitting real-estate investors, but it‚Äôs
also believed to be helpoing in the stabilization in the housing market.

The web has quickly changed many elements of the world stage from financial institutions, to music to mobile entertainment.
Numerous artists have had the flexibility to take advantage of
the world wide promoting alternatives presented by this inter-connectivity.
Just a few years in the past bands performed in bars, group activities,
and yard celebrations. These bands would make an album
send it to the music giants and hope a report offer resulted.
With the creation of digital music gamers the benefit during which music might be transferred or bought benefited small bands.
The distribution system of online shops and advertising decisions opened
up an entire new world. This new media format and plenty of personal
web sites seemingly sprang up over evening with the power to reach a worldwide audience.
Gone have been little city boundaries and even traveling
as a result of the clicking of a mouse replaced the drone of a shifting
tour bus. Nonetheless simply because a technology helps get
the word out does not mean a band has musical talent, a lot of music
web sites and bands disappeared as quick as they arrived.
What makes a band or music common? Is it the sound or the marketing?

I mean Check out our 2014 Stand Against Racism Blog Carnival ‚Äì YWCA USA is a little boring.
You might glance at Yahoo‚Äôs front page and see how they write news titles to grab viewers to open the links.
You might try adding a video or a related picture or two to

Jesus Calling says: 

April 23, 2019 at 3:11 am 


Hey, how‚Äôs it going?
I want to pass along some very important news that everyone needs to hear!
In December of 2017, Donald Trump made history by recognizing Jerusalem as the captial of Israel. Why is this big news? Because by this the Jewish people of Israel are now able to press forward in bringing about the Third Temple prophesied in the Bible.
Jewish Rabbis have publicly announced that their Messiah will be revealed in the coming years who will be a leader and spiritual guide to all nations, gathering all religions under the worship of one God.
Biblical prophecy tells us that this Jewish Messiah who will take the stage will be the antichrist ‚Äúwho opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God or that is worshiped, so that he sits as God in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God‚Äù (2 Thessalonians 2:4). For a time, he will bring about a false peace, but ‚ÄúTherefore when you see the ‚Äòabomination of desolation,‚Äô spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place (Matthew 24:15)‚Ä¶then there will be great tribulation, such as has not been since the beginning of the world until this time, no, nor ever shall be‚Äù (Matthew 24:21).
‚ÄúLittle children, it is the last hour; and as you have heard that the Antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have come, by which we know that it is the last hour‚Äù (1 John 2:18).
‚ÄúThe coming of the lawless one is according to the working of Satan, with all power, signs, and lying wonders, and with all unrighteous deception among those who perish, because they did not receive the love of the truth, that they might be saved. And for this reason God will send them strong delusion, that they should believe the lie, that they all may be condemned who did not believe the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness‚Äù (2 Thessalonians 2:9-12).
More importantly, the power that runs the world wants to put a RFID microchip in our body making us total slaves to them. This chip matches perfectly with the Mark of the Beast in the Bible, more specifically in Revelation 13:16-18:
‚ÄúHe causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, and that no one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.
Here is wisdom. Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man: His number is 666.‚Äù
Referring to the last days, this could only be speaking of a cashless society, which we have yet to see,  but are heading towards. Otherwise, we could still buy or sell without the mark amongst others if physical money was still currency. This Mark couldn‚Äôt be spiritual because the word references two different physical locations. If it was spiritual it would just say in the forehead. RFID microchip implant technology will be the future of a one world cashless society containing digital currency. It will be implanted in the right-hand or the forehead, and we cannot buy or sell without it! We must grow strong in Jesus. AT ALL COSTS, DO NOT TAKE IT!
‚ÄúThen a third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, ‚ÄúIf anyone worships the beast and his image, and receives his mark on his forehead or on his hand, he himself shall also drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out full strength into the cup of His indignation. He shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb. And the smoke of their torment ascends forever and ever; and they have no rest day or night, who worship the beast and his image, and whoever receives the mark of his name‚Äù (Revelation 14:9-11).
People have been saying the end is coming for many years, but we needed two key things. One, the Third Temple, and two, the technology for a cashless society to fulfill the prophecy of the Mark of the Beast.
Visit http://WWW.BIBLEFREEDOM.COM to see proof for these things and why the Bible trul is the word of God!
If you haven‚Äôt already, it is time to seek God with all your heart. Jesus loves you more than you could imagine. He wants to have a relationship with you and redeem you from your sins. Turn to Him and repent while there is still hope! This is forever‚Ä¶God bless!

Is it viable to get free Fortnite V-Bucks or are they locked astern genuine world money?
If you play a part Fortnite then you probably desire some pardon V-bucks.
This in-game currency is used to buy anything from the battlepass each season, to things later than cosmetics  and emotes from the Fortnite store.
Because they‚Äôre suitably sought after you‚Äôll probably look every sorts of promises and dodgy deals aimless on the order of ‚Äì don‚Äôt hear to any of them as the unaided mannerism to acquire V-bucks is in game
and anything offering you V-bucks that isn‚Äôt Fortnite will be
a scam. 
The forlorn pretentiousness to actually acquire Fortnite V-Bucks is by buying them in-game, understandably by purchasing them.
However, if you desire to in fact make Fortnite sentient stirring
to it‚Äôs ‚Äòfree to play‚Äô natural world there are a few ways to earn pardon Fortnite V-Bucks.
It will tolerate you much longer than buying them outright, but if there‚Äôs a skin you‚Äôve had your eye upon for a even if later follow these methods to earn yourself some pardon Fortnite V-Bucks.
The most within reach way to unlock clear Fortnite
V-Bucks for free is to level in the works later both
experience points and battle stars through
completing daily and Fortnite battle Pass Challenges. As you level in the works youll reach other tiers in the battle pass
system (both the pardon and paid version) and a handful
of tiers will provide you 100 V-Bucks each become old to spend in the Fortnite store.
Levelling going on comes best from playing aggressively and getting kills, enduring
longer and getting an experience bonus, and completing various challenges later getting kills in imitation of
a distinct weapon. every these accomplishments will provide you experience points that level you stirring
and fight stars that incite you accomplish additional fight pass tiers.
It pays to show more and thats exactly what Epic wants you to do.
Fortnites original and less well-liked horde mode offers daily login bonuses, daily challenges, and rewards for Storm Shield
reason missions. They are fast and easy ways to acquire a small
amount of currency each day, although youll need to actually purchase the mode.
Save The World is currently priced at $40/35,
but it goes on sale frequently if you have a tiny patience.
You can earn thousands of V-Bucks by comprehensibly playing the
game each morning and completing the missions, but if you
don‚Äôt later the core gameplay after that it can be a drag because it‚Äôs vastly interchange to
the battle royale mode.

The site is a center for you all the ads in the field, bachelorette party?

the rationale you should rent a villa for a future event or maybe a gaggle recreation appropriate for any age.
The site is also center of rooms through the hour, which is definitely another

Targeted Individuals in USA says: 

May 6, 2019 at 4:27 pm 


dangerous neuro technology is being used to hack control and torture innocent people around the world this is
a factual statement you probably or may not believe this right now but my hope is by the conclusion of this lecture
in this evening you might be more convinced I want you to imagine a world where people sit behind computers with
security clearance and listen to your most personal thoughts spy in your most private moments and actually control your mind
and body this is not science fiction this is reality we would like to talk to you tonight about
a program a program of gaslighting where the aim is to discredit the target make them look crazy and have them even question their own sanity all free
of fingerprints and sets a perfect plausible deniability
for the perpetrators committing this crime dr. Robert Duncan is going to talk to you factually about the technology and the possible intent of this program I would
also like to give my personal testimony to discuss the neural
ethical implications of this horror that crime and the human rights violations and discuss
possible solutions that we can all implement together like neuro ethical
human rights legislation I‚Äôm not going to pretend to be any type of expert on this
technology this is why I‚Äôve asked Duncan to present to you today but
like all the other victims hundreds to thousands around the
world we have a story to tell many of you invited
tonight our neuro scientists engineers professors students technical
local technology schools the area as well as human rights groups and local Congress our hope is that you will find this information relevant believable and help us to find solutions you need to know
that not only could this technology be used to drug rape torture
innocent civilians around the world it is being used to do so when it
has possibly been used for decades I Alison Amy Ireland solemnly
affirm that by all that is sacred and righteous that my testimony is
given free without coercion and that this is the whole truth the truth the whole truth and nothing
but the truth so help me God I‚Äôm a 38 year
old businesswoman in medical sales and a mother of three small children October 2015 I began being harassed
with something that is referred to as psychotronics
microwave auditory hearing effect silent sound which bypasses the ears v2k voices scholars synthetic telepathy
since then it had they have stolen the past three and a half
years of my life it started overnight people talking in my head sometimes as loud as someone
in the room next to me they use standard scripts to traumatize and document response they
would in the very beginning they kept me up for days on end not
eating not sleeping screaming the most horrible disgusting things you can even imagine all day long
24/7 they would keep me up they would sexually harass me
belittle me stripping me my dignity as a woman all of us experiencing this and I‚Äôve spoken with dozens possibly hundreds
here exactly the same things repeated to us they hear we hear our voices our thoughts repeated
back we hear voices of others responding to our thoughts we hear them narrating
what we‚Äôre doing throughout the day we literally do not have a private thought in our head or a
private moment with our families I want it to be on the record that I
do not take any drugs recreational or pharmaceutical and I have no history of
mental illness or depression sometimes I have asked something that I don‚Äôt know the answer to they will respond and I will look it up and I will find
that the answer is correct not only do they repeat what I say in my head but they will add colorful adjectives and edit my
thoughts at times like Ewen Cameron developed back in the 50s I am suggesting two automated messages psychic
driving technique repeated over and over again on a loop I
know often it is AI in my head but I also sometimes I
feel like I hear actual people talking as well they use scripts to deceive and control sometimes
they will play music recite riddles sometimes you hear things
as trivial as discussions on what they are ordering for lunch or how long their shift is
this is something I have personally been experiencing for three and a half
years on January 2 in January 2016 on my January 13th
on my 35th birthday I was drugged for the first time with what I now
believed to be a bio frequency used to generate a drugged state for almost a full year
nine months I was drugged every other day I‚Äôd go one day
feeling completely normal organically like myself and then the next day like I ate a sheet of
acid this went on and off for nine months one day on one day off one day
on one day off then it just stopped completely I was totally back
to normal again with an exception for three very specific times
when I was drugged remotely like a Pavlovian dog when I tried to do something to raise awareness of
what was happening when I went to the FBI or when I organized
a conference for victims to come together to figure out what was happening and figure
out what we could all do together this is not how paranoid schizophrenia
or any type of mental illness works I have learned
that MIT the home of the US Army super soldier has developed such
a drug delivery system luckily I experimented with LSD in college only about
four to five times not enough according to medical experts for a flashback but
at least I know knew what I was feeling was a simulation of being on a hallucinogenic and that I was not insane you want to
tell your children just say no to drugs but then again I feel
like maybe they should experiment in college
in case they get drugged remotely by the government or whoever does this to people
so they don‚Äôt end up in a mental hospital the rest of
this is gonna sound crazy and I promise if it did not happen to me personally I
would not believe a word of it but I have also seen a hologram of a
cartoon character in my room and I was raped once was something that rocked her duncan refers
to as no touch simulated rape through EEG heterodyning where you feel as though you were being
sexually assaulted for trauma-based mind control but no one is in the room with you
some victims are raped by this technology daily all day
these are all identical experiences that I have heard by countless other victims
I have also had what I believe to be manipulated dreams I was
told that it takes 90 minutes to fall into REM sleep those of us on this cybernetic
hivemind program will fall asleep and wake
up fall asleep within five seconds having a very vivid dream that seems like you‚Äôre watching a
movie either seeing things like being attacked by a bald
eagle or looking in the mirror my eye becomes a camera lens or I pull a chip out of my nose that says USA or they show me such horrific things
of my own family that literally makes me cry for weeks and makes me thank God
that I am aware of what is happening and I know in my heart
that is not my own subconscious and that I could never create something so horrific in my own mind recently within the
past year I have also been tortured with what I believe
to be emotional manipulation this has just been happening to me
within the past year organically I made very happy up the outgoing person I normally just go on with my
day then all of a sudden like somebody is literally turning on and off a light switch I
start to scream and cry and shake uncontrollably while simultaneously
the voices call repeats in my head kill yourself kill yourself kill yourself it lasts it lasts for about an hour
and it feels and then some feels like somebody is literally just turning
it off and I snapped back to normal when I asked why are you doing this the
beat UK or voice in my head says we want you to know what they have been doing
to people remotely for decades the schmeared off-patent used by the CIA with subliminal in the 50s using subliminal messaging to broadcast rage fear and manipulate human behavior as I
mentioned I am NOT going to make any claims about this technology whether I‚Äôm implanted with chips whether it‚Äôs
smart dust nanotechnology or frequency done remotely I will leave that to the experts I just want to share
my experience and the parallel experience of so many
others around the world and talk about what we can all do about it
together a few other things that may or may not be relevant I
have been told that I might have been victimized by this technology as nonsensical as it is because of my career in medical sales I was with American Medical
Systems who was then acquired by Boston Scientific
when this first started happening selling neurologic with a you not neurologic
implants I lost a really good job due to the attacks of being drugged every other day for nine months and having
my performance suffer I struggled since then to get back on track professionally hopping around to a
few different companies I have somehow been able to
though remain gainfully employed struggling every day to work through whatever I am going
through provide for my family and raise my three small children and in my
limited free time do what I can to expose these crimes
I currently work for a company allergen pharmaceuticals selling Botox for overactive bladder again in urology with a hue neurology but Allegan does work in neurology and I have and has mental health
medication salesmen mental health medication as well maybe
this is relevant maybe it isn‚Äôt but as a mind-control victim I question everything in my life since many mentoring
candidate victims are mind-control to believe that big pharma is
doing it to them I‚Äôve been told that my employment could have
something to do with it maybe I‚Äôm being set up I do believe that the company I work for now does not realize that they may be profiting off victims of this technology and I‚Äôd
like to find a way to credibly raise awareness someday with
my employer I believe every day I am helping people personally
improve their quality of life with therapeutic Botox so at this time I do not see an issue
personally with my profession I‚Äôve also been told that I could be
in this program because of my identical twin daughters or my
Jewish lineage Josef Mengele and other World War two scientists did experiment on multiples this was
one of the first questions in the symptom survey bill Binney and Kirk Wiebe
some NSA whistleblowers that are helping us conducted back in 2017 are you a multiple
paternal identical I do believe this is relevant many people also believe that this illuminati
or freemason association supposedly there has some connection with a monarch mind control style torture they do Nazi Germany and this Illuminati group honestly I and I
do think that many victims and perpetrators committing
these cry actually do buy into this stuff but honestly I think that it is irrelevant whatever excuse or justification people are making to torture other people is irrelevant the point is that people are torturing other people with technology they are
remotely drugging raping torturing and murdering this is like Nazi Germany you know
they were actually able to get neighbors to torture other neighbors you know
this is covert and done remotely but you know history does have a tendency to repeat itself
so that I think honestly the most important thing that we do right now
is expose what is happening and try together to find solutions and establish neuro
ethical legislation to protect our brains from being hacked the first psychiatrist I ever went she was named
Wendy Olsen Mauro the Hitchcock clinic in Hudson New Hampshire‚Äôs he set me on the right track she said you do
not have any mental illness do you know anybody that works
for the government this was before I learned
about this phenomenon and I thought this was such a strange bizarre question I saw her twice January 26 2016 in February 24th 2016 I then got a bizarre phone call that she had died and I needed to see someone else they sent me to another psychiatrist who
has been pushing a medication that is actually made by the company I work for now then I learned that the sales rep
for the specific medication now has the job that I
had when I first started getting tortured by this technology selling urologic implants at
Boston Scientific the year that I lost my job when I was drugged
maybe this is all complete coincidence but I felt like it was bizarre enough to mention and you know
sometimes I do wonder if we are moved around like chess pieces for some sort
of game that we don‚Äôt understand also working and organizing and strategizing with this group of victims can be sat challenging for us all in itself this group of victims trying to organize and fight back you know I believe we are mind-controlled
not to trust each other so we don‚Äôt unite and work together I‚Äôve actually
been told that my voice was used in the heads of others telling them that I
for some reason am the one that is doing this to them there is power in numbers especially in groups that are organizing organized and productive so
I believe that to keep us from being productive and fighting back they mind-control us to fight with each other or worse think that you know we‚Äôre doing this to each other I‚Äôm sure
they are there are also hired infiltration to keep things unproductive as well the point is that we need your help outside
of this community of victims it is important for anyone watching this to know that this event was not sponsored by a company or organization it was sponsored entirely financed
by the hard-earned money of a woman who was working to struggle through
what she‚Äôs experiencing and finding a way to expose
what is happening for her and her family and thousands of others around the world the truth is I personally have no idea
why I was targeted for this crime maybe it is just a random cross-section of
the population for experimentation I am an innocent hard-working taxpaying American who has committed no crimes I was
not an activist prior to being harassed by this technology I know no one that
works for the government and I have no enemies that I can think
of I had no reason to make this up and I want nothing more
to than to expose what they are doing to protect my children and to make a
better tomorrow for everyone my small children have also experienced
this voice to scold technology specifically my son aged seven this
is documented at the pediatrician when he was three he came to me and my husband and said I hear a
voice talking in my head is said not to look mommy but I didn‚Äôt listen because
I love you two two three other times since then he has also come to me saying mommy they‚Äôre doing it to me again they‚Äôre talking in my head per the
advice of other victims I‚Äôve gotten scanned by a private investigator
named Melinda kidder at Columbia investigations in Columbia Missouri
she is the leading private investigator regarding these matters scans
indicate elevated e.l.f EMF frequency emissions coming from specific registered to academic institutions government
agencies companies hired by government agencies public broadcast stations
educational broadband services providers broadband internet providers for collaborative research many of us who
have also gotten this h SCOTUS scan have shown frequencies registers the
same academic institutions agencies and companies who could possibly be defendants in it supporter
class-action possibly someday I live in New Hampshire but the frequencies are registered to institutions and companies all
over the United States and the victims of this growing crime are
all over the world I believe this is what was used to torture me with psychotronics sound and a bio frequency simulation to generate a drugged state by a remote signaling
device whether reliable evidence or not a toxicologist named held
a grand standing of Integrative Health Solutions also gave me a skin patched
in hair follicle test that revealed evidence that I was being harassed by nanotechnology
my husband and my friends can all support my claim the
most important thing to me is to expose this to protect my
family my family and victims worldwide I‚Äôm sure you were also familiar with the recent story of
the cute American diplomats in Cuba suffering the hearing loss from
the sonic attacks my four-year-old daughter was born with something called auditory
neuropathy I believe there is a chance this also might be related she was born with this crippling hearing
loss right before I started getting tortured with this technology I found clinical articles that
show how low wave frequencies like the ones being admitted from me can damage the hair and the inner ear causing this type of hearing loss she is
crippled for life and forced to wear bilateral hearing aids the Hoffer report on the diplomats did suggest that 30 to 40 percent of the diplomats did experience permanent hearing loss as
well I hired another investigator who has been able to dig
further into the Federal Communications Commission database for frequencies found on me
and I‚Äôve also been able to obtain a full comprehensive list of companies and
institutions not only the companies and institutions but specific names phone numbers and addresses of these individuals licensed to these frequencies I have
reached out to each and every one of them I‚Äôve done everything that I
can possibly think of up to this point I have been to the FBI the State Police the local police
I went back to the FBI recently and this time instead of
getting drugged like I was the first time gonna went they actually did open an investigation for me and gave me a case
number I have emailed called and sent certified
letters to over a hundred civil rights class actions personal injury lawyers
but for whatever bizarre reason I have not been able to obtain anyone I have contacted emailed or gone in person ACLU fusion center DARPA
and also desperately trying to get a meeting with my local
Congress most importantly my story is not unique and is trivial in compared to the atrocities of so many others around the world by this remote technology
this is a silent crime as I said incomplete plausible deniability the assailants the victims are gaslighted mean to appear mentally ill
these crimes against humanity are so horrific and I feel these
are the biggest threat that our society faces today what we need is to raise public awareness overall awareness
and discuss neuro ethical human rights legislation that we can implement to protect our minds
from these attacks please pays attention also when Duncan covers
Project Blue Beam this is the rumor you know and this is again conspiracy theory was supposedly leaked by NASA some sort of staged apocalyptic alien invasion religious rapture using
this technology you know we know victims of this technology
the technology in place subliminal mind-control
voices in your head holograms a frequency that makes you feel like
you‚Äôre on LSD making you more susceptible as a subliminal mind control
so all these tools in their tool bag right so this is of course a conspiracy
you know but knowing that this technology exists you know what if we were the guinea
pigs the you know pilot program for before this is rolled
out on the general public you know I‚Äôm hoping obviously this is just a conspiracy theory but literally
knowing about this technology and what‚Äôs happening to people
could literally save your life what boggles my mind and obviously the minds of others is if the technology does exist right for people‚Äôs brains to be hacked remotely why is
there still crime why does it seem that this technology is being
used to torture innocent people driving them to homicide or suicide you know I want you to
if you aren‚Äôt familiar look up the stories of you know people like Myra Mae Aaron Alexis all of these mass shooters where it comes out
after that they had voices in their head that led them to do it
all of the suicides of the victims of this technology the only conclusion I can think of as to ranged as the scenes is that maybe
they want things to get as bad you know so bad that we all accept 1984 Minority Report future without a private thought in her head or a private moment in our families you know as a welcome order from the
chaos that they might create hopefully again conspiracy theory today we have invited 5,000 professors students local human rights groups bioethics groups mental health professionals local Congress in the general
public the ad in the globe it‚Äôs a circulation of 225 thousand myself as well as other volunteers have been being
remotely tortured have been tirelessly sending emails handing out fliers putting up billboards organizing events like
this I have participated in dozens of symptom surveys and affidavit

Jesus Calling says: 

May 11, 2019 at 4:51 am 


Hey, how‚Äôs it going?
I want to pass along some very important news that everyone needs to hear!
In December of 2017, Donald Trump made history by recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Why is this big news? Because by this the Jewish people of Israel are now able to press forward in bringing about the Third Temple prophesied in the Bible.
Jewish Rabbis have publicly announced that their Messiah will be revealed in the coming years who will be a leader and spiritual guide to all nations, gathering all religions under the worship of one God.
Biblical prophecy tells us that this Jewish Messiah who will take the stage will be the antichrist ‚Äúwho opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God or that is worshiped, so that he sits as God in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God‚Äù (2 Thessalonians 2:4). For a time he will bring about a false peace, but ‚ÄúTherefore when you see the ‚Äòabomination of desolation,‚Äô spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place (Matthew 24:15)‚Ä¶then there will be great tribulation, such as has not been since the beginning of the world until this time, no, nor ever shall be‚Äù (Matthew 24:21).
More importantly, the power that runs the world wants to put a RFID microchip in our body making us total slaves to them. This chip matches perfectly with the Mark of the Beast in the Bible, more specifically in Revelation 13:16-18:
‚ÄúHe causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, and that no one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.
Here is wisdom. Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man: His number is 666.‚Äù
Referring to the last days, this could only be speaking of a cashless society, which we have yet to see,  but are heading towards. Otherwise, we could still buy or sell without the mark amongst others if physical money was still currency. This Mark couldn‚Äôt be spiritual because the word references two different physical locations. If it was spiritual it would just say in the forehead. RFID microchip implant technology will be the future of a one world cashless society containing digital currency. It will be implanted in the right-hand or the forehead, and we cannot buy or sell without it. Revelation 13:11-18 tells us that a false prophet will arise on the world scene doing miracles before men, deceiving them to receive this Mark. Do not be deceived! We must grow strong in Jesus. AT ALL COSTS, DO NOT TAKE IT!
‚ÄúThen a third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, ‚ÄúIf anyone worships the beast and his image, and receives his mark on his forehead or on his hand, he himself shall also drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out full strength into the cup of His indignation. He shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb. And the smoke of their torment ascends forever and ever; and they have no rest day or night, who worship the beast and his image, and whoever receives the mark of his name‚Äù (Revelation 14:9-11).
People have been saying the end is coming for many years, but we needed two key things. One, the Third Temple, and two, the technology for a cashless society to fulfill the prophecy of the Mark of the Beast.
Visit http://WWW.BIBLEFREEDOM.COM to see proof for these things and why the Bible truly is the word of God!
If you haven‚Äôt already, it is time to seek God with all your heart. Jesus loves you more than you could imagine. He wants to have a relationship with you and redeem you from your sins. Turn to Him and repent while there is still hope! This is forever‚Ä¶God bless!
‚ÄúEITHER HUMAN INTELLIGENCE ULTIMATELY OWES ITS ORIGIN TO MINDLESS MATTER OR THERE IS A CREATOR‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Äì JOHN LENNOX
We all know God exists. Why? Because without Him, we couldn‚Äôt prove anything at all. Do we live our lives as if we cannot know anything? No. So why is God necessary? In order to know anything for certain, you would have to know everything, or have revelation from somebody who does. Who is capable of knowing everything? God. So to know anything, you would have to be God, or know God.
A worldview without God cannot account for the uniformity and intelligibility of nature. And why is it that we can even reason that God is the best explanation for this if there is no God? We are given reason to know or reject God, but never to know that He does not exist.
It has been calculated by Roger Penrose that the odds of the initial conditions for the big bang to produce the universe that we see to be a number so big, that we could put a zero on every particle in the universe, and even that would not be enough to use every zero. What are the odds that God created the universe? Odds are no such thing. Who of you would gamble your life on one coin flip?
Is there evidence that the Bible is the truth? Yes. Did you know that the creation accounts listed in the book of Genesis are not only all correct, but are also in the correct chronological order? That the Bible doesn‚Äôt say the Earth was formed in six 24-hour days but rather six long but finite periods of time? That the Bible makes 10 times more creation claims than all major ‚Äúholy‚Äù books combined with no contradictions, while these other books have errors in them? The Bible stood alone by concurring with the big bang saying, ‚ÄúIn the beginning God created the heaven and the earth‚Äù (Genesis 1:1); and says our universe is expanding, thousands of years before scientists discovered these things. Watch a potential life-changing video on the website listed below with Astronomer(PhD) Hugh Ross explaining all these facts based on published scientific data. He has authored many books, backed even by atheist scientists.
Jesus came to pay a debt that we could not; to be our legal justifier to reconcile us back to a Holy God; only if we are willing to receive Him: ‚ÄúFor the wages of sin is death‚Ä¶‚Äù (Romans 6:23).
God so loved the world that He gave us His only begotten son, so that whoever believes in Him, through faith, shall not perish, but have everlasting life. Jesus says if we wish to enter into life to keep the commands! The two greatest commands are to love God with all your heart, soul, strength, and mind; and your neighbor as yourself. All the law hang on these commands. We must be born of and lead by the Holy Spirit, to be called children of God, to inherit the kingdom. If we are willing to humble ourselves in prayer to Jesus, to confess and forsake our sins, He is willing to give the Holy Spirit to those who keep asking of Him; giving us a new heart, leading us into all truth!
Jesus came to free us from the bondage of sin. The everlasting fire was prepared for the devil and his angels due to disobedience to God‚Äôs law. If we do the same, what makes us any different than the devil? Jesus says unless we repent, we shall perish. For sin is the transgression of the law. We must walk in the Spirit so we may not fulfill the lusts of the flesh, being hatred, fornication, drunkenness and the like. Whoever practices such things will not inherit the kingdom (Galatians 5:16-26). If we sin, we may come before Jesus to ask for forgiveness (1 John 2:1-2). Evil thoughts are not sins, but rather temptations. It is not until these thoughts conceive and give birth by our own desires that they become sin (James 1:12-15). When we sin, we become in the likeness of the devil‚Äôs image, for he who sins     is of the devil (1 John 3:8); but if we obey Jesus, in the image of God. For without holiness, we shall not see the Lord (Hebrews 12:14).
The oldest religion in the world is holiness through faith (James 1:27). What religion did Adam and Eve follow before the fall? Jesus, Who became the last Adam, what religion does He follow? Is He not holy? He never told us to follow the rituals and traditions of man but to take up our cross and follow Him (Luke 9:23). There are many false doctrines being taught leading people astray. This is why we need the Holy Spirit for discernment. Unlike religion, holiness cannot be created. It is given to us from above by the baptism of the Spirit. Jesus is more than a religion; He is about having a personal relationship with the Father. Start by reading the Gospel of Matthew, to hear the words of God, to know His character and commandments. Follow and obey Jesus, for He is the way, the truth, and the life!

The beset way to do this can be to lay him on his right side,
open his mouth, take out his tongue a bit and find out

you could consider looking around to determine what exactly is
right for you to have involved with. A deacon or lay person making an effective hospital
visit probably have a conversation something like
this.

Epoxy dikenal sebagai jenis lem yang sangat tahan lama yang memberi pengguna sifat ikatan yg tinggi.
Epoksi dilihat sebagai sesuatu yg jauh lebih unggul dari sebagian agung lem gaya tempel.
Komponen epoksi dijual dalam dua paket yg membutuhkan pencampuran sebelum dimanfaatkan Komponen-komponen ini ialah resin dan pengeras.
Banyak bangunan industri dan komersial memakai lantai epoksi di fasilitas gedung mereka karena jumlahnya penghematan budget dan manfaat
keamanan yg diberikan kepada pengguna.
Meski beton dianggap tidak dapat dihancurkan, beton tak tahan terhadap kerusakan type tertentu, termasuk kosmetik, seperti lecet, retak, & pewarnaan. Ini sanggup merusak keseluruhan daya tarik
lantai. Beton berpori dan dapat menyerap kotoran, garam, bahan kimia & minyak, sehingga
sulit untuk membersihkan lantai beton bersama benar.
Dengan menerapkan lapisan epoksi pada beton, beton melindungi.
Lantai epoksi memiliki lapisan mengkilap yg mampu meningkatkan reflektivitas cahaya sampai 200%.
Ini bakal menutup permukaan beton berpori dan membuatnya menjadi noda.
Lantai epoksi pula amat sangat sederhana utk dibersihkan sebab tidak ada bahan utk digantung.
Lantaran struktur kimia epoksi, itu amat sangat tahan lama
pula tahan gores. Tak seperti memanfaatkan cat berbasis lateks, individu yg memanfaatkan produk epoksi padatan berbahan dasar resin tak perlu mengecat lantainya tiap-tiap beberapa tahun Faktanya, satu lapisan lantai epoksi berbahan dasar padat sanggup
bertahan dijamin seumur hidup. Poin utamanya ialah nyeri lantai epoksi akan berikatan dengan molekul semen di lantai
mana pun utk memberikan hasil yg tahan lama. Ikatan molekuler ini jauh
lebih kuat dari adhesi yg disediakan oleh cat lain, termasuk juga
cat berbasis enamel dan lateks. Ini membuatnya teramat baik
untuk digunakan di daerah di mana ada dulu lintas pejalan kaki yg berat atau mesin berat.
Lantai epoksi biasanya ditemukan di sebanyak lokasi termasuk juga tempat bawah tanah, & lantai garasi,
teras dalam area toko ritel, restoran, hunian sakit, media manufaktur, & laboratorium,
yg semuanya membutuhkan lantai yg kuat dan tahan lama. Beberapa
pemilik hunian bahkan ingin lantai dapur mereka dibuat dgn dilapisi dgn epoksi.
Tidak Cuma daya tahan lantai epoksi, dia dapat menahan kerusakan yang disebabkan oleh beraneka larutan kimia.
Ini berarti tidak cuma tidak bakal rusak oleh pembersih lantai kimia, tetapi apabila laboratorium mempunyai lantai epoksi & beberapa bahan kimia tumpah,
itu tidak akan merusak lantai.
Lapisan epoksi buat lantai serta amat murah di bandingkan bersama tipe selesai lantai
lainnya termasuk juga karpet, ubin, kayu dan vinil.
Nyeri poli urea rata rata berharga hingga empat kali lipat dari jumlah lantai epoksi dan pemilik rumah
atau pemilik usaha tak menonton manfaat dari peningkatan budget Ini amat ekonomis dan lantaran tahan lama, lantai epoksi
merupakan investasi yang tahan lama. Cowok & wanita tak
butuh lakukan pekerjaan yang terus-menerus lantaran efeknya yg tahan lama.
Akhirnya pelapis lantai amat sederhana untuk dibersihkan & dirawat.
Dampak dari lalu lintas, minyak, garam dan bahan kimia
di garasi, sarana komersial dan industri sulit
untuk dihilangkan dan mahal buat diperbaiki kalau tak dirawat.
Tak hanya menciptakan frustrasi dan memakan dikala tapi pun sanggup amat mahal.

An intriguing discussion is definitely worth comment.
I do think that you need to write more about this topic, it may
not be a taboo matter but usually folks don‚Äôt speak
about these topics. To the next! Many thanks!!

Its like you learn my thoughts! You appear to grasp so much about this, like you
wrote the guide in it or something. I believe that you simply can do with some % to power the message home
a bit, but other than that, this is magnificent blog.
A fantastic read. I‚Äôll certainly be back.

Great blog! Is your theme custom made or did you download it from somewhere?
A design like yours with a few simple adjustements would really make my blog shine.
Please let me know where you got your theme.
Thank you

Today, I went to the beachfront with my children. I found a sea shell and gave it
to my 4 year old daughter and said ‚ÄúYou can hear the ocean if you put this to your ear.‚Äù She put the
shell to her ear and screamed. There was a hermit crab inside and it pinched her ear.
She never wants to go back! LoL I know this is entirely off topic but I had to tell someone!
