Welcome to the YWCA Map: A National Footprint of Women’s Empowerment! Each year, YWCAs nationwide serve over 2.3 million women, girls, and their families. This interactive map showcases the local, state, and regional impact of over 200 YWCAs across the country. Click on the map below to begin using this online tool. Our new YWCA Opportunity Zones map aims to connect Opportunity Zones stakeholders with YWCAs serving Opportunity Zones residents nationwide.
