Improving the health and safety of women and girls of color
YWCA has long advocated for the health and safety of women and girls. As the largest network of domestic violence service providers in the country, we remain committed to supporting survivors and reducing violence against women and girls. Annually, more than 900,000 women and families participate in YWCA health and safety programs and services — from domestic violence and sexual assault services to aquatics and fitness programs, health resources and referrals.
YWCA seeks to improve the lives of women and girls by providing high-quality health and wellness programs that are too often not available to communities of color. We serve 400,000 women, girls and their families with health screening programs, fitness classes and other programs and services that address health inequities.
In addition to our direct services, for over 20 years YWCA has hosted the annual Week Without Violence campaign, which mobilizes people in communities across the United States to take action against all forms of violence, wherever it may occur. Through rich and complex dialogues on violence, workshops, community service opportunities and public awareness events, Week Without Violence places the pervasive nature of violence and its impact on the communities we serve at the forefront of the conversation.
Nationally, YWCA continues to advocate for increased access to health care, reduction of racial health disparities, and protections for victims of gender-based violence, and we support public policies that would benefit the women, girls and families we serve every day.
