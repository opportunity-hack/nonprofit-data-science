Long History of YWCA Support for Military Families

By Adrianne Singer
President and CEO of YWCA Greenwich
Adrianne Singer
A core mission of the YWCA is “empowering women,” and helping them to reach their fullest potential. In this regard, I read with interest that the YWCA has been engaged with military families for more than a century…co-founding the USO…establishing Hostess House for service men and women…promoting Liberty Bonds during WW1…training women to fill the jobs of enlisted men…and supporting military and veteran women through the most recent conflicts.
Our YWCA has watched with respect and appreciation as efforts to support military families locally have evolved. U. S. Senator Richard Blumenthal and our Congressman Jim Himes were instrumental in opening a Connecticut home to house homeless women veterans and their children. This simple but important effort began with Shalini Madaras, who founded the program in honor of her son PFC Nicholas A. Madaras who was killed in Iraq. Shalini then partnered with The Applied Behavioral Rehabilitation Institute to help open the Female Soldiers: Forgotten Heroes Home for the Brave in Bridgeport, CT.
YWCA Greenwich applauds these efforts to support military families and hosted an opening reception and press event promoting a fundraiser for Female Soldiers: Forgotten Heroes Home for the Brave. The YWCA joined with well known, local artist Janet Baldi to feature her paintings for one month in our art gallery and Janet donated 50% of her sales to the Home for the Brave.
We send each and every military family across the country a heart-felt thank you and wishes for a peaceful Memorial Day. Thank you for all that you do.

The YWCA’s history of supporting women for over 150 years is indeed extraordinary. Thank you, YWCA Greenwich, for continuing the tradition and honoring the women who have served before us and serve us now.

With havin so much content and articles do you ever run into any issues
of plagorism or copyright infringement? My site has a lot of exclusive content I’ve either authored myself
or outsourced but it appears a lot of it is popping it up all over the web without
my agreement. Do you know any solutions to help prevent content from being ripped off?
I’d definitely appreciate it.

When someone writes an article he/she maintains the idea of a user in his/her mind that how a user
can know it. Thus that’s why this piece of writing is amazing.
Thanks!
