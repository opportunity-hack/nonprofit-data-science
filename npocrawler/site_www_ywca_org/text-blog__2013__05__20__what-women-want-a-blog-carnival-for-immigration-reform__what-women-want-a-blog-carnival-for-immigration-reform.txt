YWCA USA Social Media Manager
On June 6, 2013, activists and allies will collectively advocate for the passage of comprehensive, common-sense reform with a focus on women, girls and immigrant communities as part of “What Women Want: A National Day of Action for Immigration Reform.”
We’re getting ready for this Day of Action with our What Women Want blog carnival, focusing on this question:
What do immigrant women need the most from comprehensive reform?
Right now, the Senate Judiciary Committee is in the middle of the markup process for the Border Security, Economic Opportunity and Immigration Modernization Act, S. 744. We want to hear from you about what your priorities are for immigration reform, and why reform matters for women and families. What are the biggest challenges for women? How will immigration reform affect your family? We also encourage you to write about the programs and initiatives you are taking part in to make comprehensive reform a reality!

The YWCA USA will collect the blog posts and publish them throughout the day on Thursday, May 30. We will also be sharing posts on Twitter with the hashtag #women4CIR . You are welcome to publish your post and any other posts from the carnival on your own website or blog.  (Don’t know what a blog carnival is? Click here.)
Please email your submission to kstanton@ywca.org by Tuesday, May 28, at 5 pm.
Your submission should include the following:

The blog post author’s name, title, and a 50-word bio
The link to the blog post OR the blog post in a Word document
Any photos or video links that you would like to include
Your Twitter handle or your organization’s Twitter handle (if you have one)
You are welcome to publish your piece on your own blog or website – please include the following language at the bottom of your post.

This post is a part of the YWCA USA’s What Women Want blog carnival about immigration reform. Read all of the posts and join the National Day of Action on June 6.
For more ways to get involved in our Day of Action for Immigration Reform, visit ywca.org or send an email to Qudsia Jafree, Senior Policy Associate, Racial Justice and Civil Rights.

Today, I went to the beach with my children. I found a sea shell and gave it
to my 4 year old daughter and said “You can hear the ocean if you put this to your ear.” She put the shell to her ear and
screamed. There was a hermit crab inside and it pinched
her ear. She never wants to go back! LoL I know this is totally off topic but I had to tell someone!

I was wondering if you ever considered changing the
layout of your website? Its very well written; I love what youve got to say.
But maybe you could a little more in the way of content so people
could connect with it better. Youve got an awful lot of text for only
having one or two images. Maybe you could space it out better?
