Racism. Why are we still talking about it?

By Colleen Butler, Racial Justice Director, and Rachel Krinsky, CEO
YWCA Madison
Are you growing tired of talking about race with no clear solution in sight? Despite much progress, racial inequity continues to grow, and the collective feeling of disappointment in our failure to do better as a community is palpable.
We are wondering: “Why do we keep talking about this, and why doesn’t it get better? Whose fault is it? What are the solutions?”
The YWCA Madison suggests that the reason we keep talking about this without making much tangible progress has to do with the fact that racial disparities are part of a large and complex system of racial inequalities. And, to be clear, we believe that race IS a relevant issue – it is not “just about poverty.”
Racial disparities in any system can be understood in two different ways, requiring two different responses. Either we can believe that everyone has equal opportunity, requiring us to identify people of color as the source of their own poorer outcomes or we can believe that racial inequality has been built through a very long history of inequitable policies that still have lasting and real effects today, even if nobody wants them to.

The latter viewpoint suggests that, even if most systems and people are no longer actively or intentionally racist, a legacy of advantages remains, and these advantages are the source of racial disparity. This viewpoint also suggests that equality, meaning that everyone gets the same thing, is not enough. Rather, it requires solutions based on equity, meaning that everyone gets what they need to reach the same level of access to opportunity.
If we are really serious about racial equity, we would consider every decision and discussion — from budget allocation to what we say and print about political candidates — with racial equity in mind. We would think holistically about our future as a more racially diverse community and deliberately welcome and retain professionals of color. Individual strategies, action plans or initiatives are less likely to be successful if they are not part of a larger, intentional, community-wide racial justice strategy.

Rachel Krinsky holds a Master’s Degree in Social Work from the University of Utah and is a Licensed Clinical Social Worker. Krinsky previously served as the Executive Director of The Road Home Dane County for over 11 years. Rachel’s previous work included family and school counseling through Briarpatch.

Have you ever considered about adding a little bit more
than just your articles? I mean, what you say is valuable and
everything. However imagine if you added some great pictures or video clips to give your posts more, “pop”!
Your content is excellent but with images and clips,
this website could certainly be one of the greatest in its niche.
Superb blog!

Hi there! I know this is kinda off topic but I’d figured I’d ask.
Would you be interested in exchanging links or maybe guest
writing a blog post or vice-versa? My blog covers a lot of the same
topics as yours and I feel we could greatly benefit from each other.
If you might be interested feel free to send me an email.
I look forward to hearing from you! Terrific blog by the way!
