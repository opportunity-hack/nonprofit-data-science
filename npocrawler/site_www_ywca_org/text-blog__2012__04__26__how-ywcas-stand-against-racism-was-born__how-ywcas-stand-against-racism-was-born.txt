How YWCA’s “Stand Against Racism” Event Was Born

Even though the Stand Against Racism event began as a movement in April 2007, it was born in July of 2006. Two YWCA CEOs, twelve miles apart and very different, met over wine to get to get to know one another. Jose Hernandez was at his job at YWCA Trenton six months longer than myself and wanted to offer support. We talked about our incredible mission of eliminating racism and empowering women and Jose talked about his daughter, Allie, who at the time was 13 months old, who already had to Stand Against Racism… Almost as simple as that, except Jose has an incredible vision sense that brought us to where we are today!
In 2007, the YWCA Trenton and the YWCA Princeton joined forces because we wanted to bring people together from all different walks of life and let us take a pledge together to Stand Against Racism and realize that it still exists. We thought people might be reluctant to Stand but found the total opposite! People wanted to take a Stand; they just didn’t know how to do it! So, we put a program in a “can” and what started as 5,000 people in Mercer County, N.J., in 2007 became 267,000 participants at 71 YWCAs across the country in 2011! And, we are still growing and improving!
Join us. Take a Stand! Collectively, we can speak out with one voice to eliminate racism, once and for all.
Judith Hutton is the CEO of YWCA Princeton and co-founder of the Stand Against Racism.

The YWCA USA is a leader in working to Eliminate Racism for many, many years beginning: in the early forties, and when Dr. Dorothy Height directed the YWCA Office of Racial Justice in 1950 and led training for staff and volunteers in the YWCA all over the country. The One Imperative: “To Eliminate Racism By Any Means Possible” was voted in by action taken at the YWCA USA National Convention, 1970, in Houston, Texas. And, the work of the YWCA continues.
