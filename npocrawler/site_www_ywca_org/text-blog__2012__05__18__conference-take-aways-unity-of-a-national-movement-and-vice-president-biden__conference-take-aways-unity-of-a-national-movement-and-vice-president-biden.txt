Conference Take-Aways: Unity of a National Movement and Vice President Biden
May 18, 2012

Tags: 2012 YWCA National Conference, CA, Maria Abenes, YWCA of Orange County, ywca usa

Executive Director, YWCA of Central Orange County, Calif.
Maria Abenes
The main thing that I will take away from this conference as a young woman of the YWCA is the feeling of unity and belonging attached to being part of a national movement. I was one of 400 individuals from across the country congregating in our nation’s capital because we all believe in the same mission of empowering women and eliminating racism…so powerful! Although I come from a very small local organization, this experience has made me feel stronger and connected. I can’t describe the pride I felt seeing persimmon everywhere especially since they were accompanied by warm smiles and welcoming words.  I think Vice President Joe Biden said it best when he shared, “I came among you, you took me in and I am so proud to call you my friends.”
Thank you to the YWCA USA for the opportunity to attend, the camaraderie I experienced and valuable knowledge I attained.
Maria Abenes has been with the YWCA Central Orange County for almost seven years and currently serves as the Executive Director. She received her Bachelor’s in Psychology from Loyola Marymount University and Masters in Counseling Psychology from Argosy University and is currently working on her Educational Doctorate in Counseling and Non-Profit management (Dissertation Phase). She has been working in the social service field for almost 11 years, focusing on at-risk youth and the issues associated with this population such as substance abuse, resiliency, self-esteem, eating disorders and domestic violence.

You can definitely see your expertise within the work you write.
The sector hopes for even more passionate writers like you who aren’t afraid to mention how they believe.
At all times follow your heart.

It’s great that you are getting ideas from this paragraph as well
as from our argument made here.

Do you have a spam issue on this site; I also am a blogger,
and I was curious about your situation; many of us have developed some nice methods and we are looking to swap solutions with others,
be sure to shoot me an email if interested.

I always spent my half an hour to read this weblog’s content every day along with a mug of coffee.

I have been browsing on-line more than three hours nowadays, but I by no means found
any attention-grabbing article like yours. It is pretty price sufficient for
me. In my view, if all web owners and bloggers made good content material as you probably did,
the internet shall be much more helpful than ever before.
