It’s On Us to Shift How We Talk About Sexual Assault
October 15, 2014

By Doug Bair
Managing Editor, Generation Progress
In an event at the White House last month, President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden launched the It’s On Us campaign in partnership with Generation Progress.
In a culture where one in five women and one in 16 men are sexually assaulted in college, it is more important than ever to engage in discussions that create a shift in the way we think about, talk about and act around sexual assault.
“To the survivors who are leading the fight against sexual assault on campuses, your efforts have helped to start a movement,” President Obama said. “But we’re here to say, today, it’s not on you. This is not your fight alone. This is on all of us, every one of us, to fight campus sexual assault.”
Obama also emphasized the need to reach out to men through this campaign.
“Most young men on college campuses are not perpetrators. But the rest of us can help stop those who think in these terms and shut stuff down,” Obama said. “It is your responsibility to tell your buddy when he’s messing up.”
Vice President Biden discussed how a change of conversation around the topic of sexual assault is needed.
“It is never the right question for a woman to ask, ‘What did I do?’ Never. Get this straight: never is it appropriate for a woman to ask, ‘What did I do?’ The question is, ‘Why was that done to me, and will someone do something about it?,” Biden said.
The It’s On Us campaign includes partnerships with student leaders from almost 200 colleges and universities throughout the country, collegiate sports organizations such as the NCAA, celebrities, sports stars, private companies, non-profits, and many more.
It’s on us to recognize that if someone does not or cannot consent to sex, it’s sexual assault. It’s on us to take responsibility for our actions and our inaction. It’s on us to realize we have a role to play in stopping sexual assault. It’s on us. All of us. Take the pledge at itsonus.org.

A fascinating discussion is worth comment. I think that you
ought to write more on this topic, it may not be a taboo
matter but typically folks don’t speak about such topics.
To the next! Cheers!!

it’s got some overlapping issues. I simply wanted to give you a quick heads up!

You really make it seem so easy with your presentation but I find
this topic to be actually something that I think I would never understand.
It seems too complex and extremely broad for me. I’m looking forward for your next post, I’ll try to get the hang of it!
