Women Empowerment 360o Program
Women’s Empowerment 360 (WE360) is a national YWCA program designed to put women and women of color entrepreneurs, who are fearless leaders and innovative shakers, on the path to starting a successful business that moves us closer to creating a more equitable world that see women the way we do: Equal. Powerful. Unstoppable.
YWCA’s WE360 is designed to:

Establish and continue to support women in becoming entrepreneurs
Incorporate wrap-around economic development services designed to create jobs, as well as increase the number of women and BIPOC owned business
Advocate and assist with the incubation of new business

The WE360 program utilizes an online program developed and led by our partner Ureeka. The course curriculum supports entrepreneurs throughout their journey from establishing a business plan to financing and scaling their business by connecting them with the people and programs to help them launch and grow their business.
Who this course is for:

Aspiring or budding entrepreneurs
Main street and “mom & pop” businesses
Part-timers – farmers, market vendors, online sellers
Small businesses and job creators
Full-time employees looking to start their own business
