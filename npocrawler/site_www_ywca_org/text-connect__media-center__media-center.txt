Media Center
YWCA has been on the frontlines of the biggest issues of the day for over 160 years, and with our focus on eliminating racism and empowering women, we can speak to our work in communities across the U.S. on everything from ending the criminalization of women and girls of color to trauma-informed care. Additionally, as the largest provider of domestic violence shelters and services in the country we can offer insights on best practices and share stories of impact. Our Interim CEO Elisha Rhodes welcomes the opportunity to speak about YWCA’s work, and our team can connect you with other experts from our organization across the U.S.
