Millennial Women and Mentors: One Young Woman‚Äôs Response to ‚ÄúShut Up, Sheryl Sandberg‚Äù

The recent Forbes article ‚ÄúShut Up, Sheryl Sandberg: Millennial Women Reject Role Models, Mentors‚Äù by J. Maureen Henderson misrepresents the perception I feel my fellow millennial women professionals have ‚Äì we are not rejecting mentors; we are just processing ‚Äúmentorship‚Äù in a different way.
‚ÄúShut Up, Sheryl Sandberg‚Äù acknowledges that both parties have different career goals: the mentor is typically an older female leader who has climbed the corporate ladder and would like to groom someone to follow in her footsteps. Young women in mentee positions are not aspiring to climb the corporate ladder in as high numbers as their mentors. Instead, more young women are seeking a career path that allows them to be innovative and creative, and that‚Äôs personally fulfilling.¬†
That said, what this article actually identifies, but does not further explore, are the unaligned expectations from both parties. ‚ÄúShut Up, Sheryl Sandberg‚Äù looks at mentoring with a traditional lens: the mentor expects to have a prot√©g√© ‚Äì someone to perpetuate current best practices in existing business settings of long-standing corporations. On the other hand, young women professionals are not seeking to replicate an individual or perpetuate an organizational entity as it stands. Instead, the type of mentoring they are seeking are opportunities to learn tools, tips and best practices, so that they can combine this knowledge with their own strengths and industries, in order create new businesses, improve upon ideas or reinvent existing business models.
I feel that while young women today are able to recognize the valuable business and political maneuvering tactics they are taught, they are also able to recognize that their professional growth is taking place in a different work setting than what existed ten, 20 or even 30 years ago. While issues like workplace harassment and (un)equal pay still exist, millennial women entering the work force now face new socio-economic and political settings: prolonged economic depression coupled with higher tuition, student loan interest rates and housing costs; innovative technology and new communications channels; community-focused business practices and initiatives; and current popularity of ‚Äúsocial good.‚Äù Among my peers, pursuing ‚Äúsocial good‚Äù careers involving social enterprise, corporate social responsibility and ‚Äúgiving back‚Äù is applauded whereas pursuing a ‚Äútraditional‚Äù career in something lucrative but destructive (such as working for an oil company) is generally frowned upon.
Further, young women now live and work in a time when mainstream media, industry journals and blogs encourage the fostering of entrepreneurial spirit and pursuit of happiness and fulfillment instead of highlighting the benefits of climbing the corporate ladder and the massive paychecks that accompany these executive-level positions. So, instead of seeing more women seek mentorship to become CEOs of large corporations, some young women seek mentorship so that they are able to start their own small business.
While young women may not want to be a duplicate of an accomplished female leader and follow the same career aspirations, young women do appreciate the idea of learning best practices from older women leaders. They may just apply that knowledge differently than their mentor expected.
I would hope that as we young women are being mentored, we are not blindly accepting everything we are taught. I would encourage young women professionals to reflect upon and identify what your own strengths, leadership style and beliefs are in comparison with our mentors. Knowing this first sets the foundation to how we accept mentoring and also shapes what kind of career leader we will be in the future ‚Äì whether it‚Äôs for a large corporation, our own business or a position in government.
As the development & advocacy manager for the YWCA of O‚Äòahu, Carmille Lim, 25, is tasked with fundraising for its three locations, and developing the association‚Äôs new public policy and advocacy platform. Serving on the Hawai‚Äòi State Commission on the Status of Women, Carmille is the youngest gubernatorial appointee; she has also been recently selected as one of Pacific Business News‚Äô ‚Äú2012 Forty Under 40,‚Äù which recognizes the state‚Äôs brightest young business professionals. For balance in her life, Carmille studies ballet and taekwondo.

I am in complete agreement with Carmille on Forbes‚Äô ‚ÄúShut Up, Sheryl Sandberg‚Äù article.  When I first began reading the article, I was perplexed by the negative tone of the article.  For one, I think the fact that 84% of respondents could find at least female leader within their job field should be celebrated.  While there is much progress that needs to happen for female leadership within many work sectors, the identification of female leaders is an indication of how much has been achieved by women in the past few decades.  The fact that there are identifiable female role models for Millennial Women needs to be celebrated.
Furthermore, the fact that Generation Y doesn‚Äôt want to follow the career path of their role models shouldn‚Äôt be seen as a rejection, but instead of sign of progress.  Our role models had to push and fight to get to the top and become leaders for future women and their mark on the world has been made.  Generation Y has seen their success and the difference these women have made and are looking to bring about positive change for their own generation.  As the article mentions, 84% of Millennial Women find making a difference in the world is more important than professional recognition; essentially, these women are following in the steps of their mentors, but don‚Äôt have their sights set on the top rung of the ladder.
Instead of the negative tone presented in ‚ÄúShut Up, Sheryl Sandberg,‚Äù readers and Millennial Women need to focus on the forgotten positives: that we have role models to give us advice for our careers (though we do not have to follow in their footsteps) and we also have the ability to make a difference for future generations.

I spent four years trying EVERYTHING in Online Dating, and through a huge amount of trial and error, I produced a system that I will share for you. This book will take you, step by step, through everything you need to know to double, triple or even quadruple the number of women you meet online.

I travel all around the world for work, and it used to be really lonely. Now I can go onto Tinder and have a date lined up in a new city before I even get out of the airport!

If you ever did try Phallomax, please drop your thoughts below. I am about to try it out. Have seen about this remedy some good reviews. Just wondering on how many more cm would that thing add to my little Woody down there hah üòÄ

I‚Äôve used Phallomax for a quite long time. No doubts it is obviously the best solution for ‚Äúthat‚Äù problem. Got it from the UK within a few days and I live in Nepal. Well worth of money spent.

Hi! I know this is kinda off topic but I was wondering which blog platform are you using for this site? I‚Äôm getting tired of WordPress because I‚Äôve had problems with hackers and I‚Äôm looking at alternatives for another platform. I would be great if you could point me in the direction of a good platform.

Awesome input. Btw have you heard about this product: http://bit.ly/2N5npwG Looks like it‚Äôs one of those products you don‚Äôt normally talk about. I have come across it on yesterday and I think I‚Äôd test it out just to see how good it is. Have seen some video reviews on Dailymotion and they look legit (I mean not scripted). Not many products out there have so many positive opinions. Have a look on it, maybe this can finally solve our problems (or at least yours).

Hi, I think your site might be having browser compatibility issues. When I look at your website in Ie, it looks fine but when opening in Internet Explorer, it has some overlapping. I just wanted to give you a quick heads up! Other then that, awesome blog!
