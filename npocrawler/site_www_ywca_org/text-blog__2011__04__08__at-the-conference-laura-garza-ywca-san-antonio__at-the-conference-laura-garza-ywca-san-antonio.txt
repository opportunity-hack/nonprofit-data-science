Laura Garza of YWCA San Antonio at the YWCA National Conference in Washington, D.C.
Capitol Hill Day was a great experience; enjoyed talking to congressmen and staff.¬† I hope that they got the message that cutting CCDBG (Child Care and Development Block Grant Act) and CDBG (Community Development Block Grant) is not the answer.¬† These cuts are going to impact our women and children in our communities.¬† It will create more unemployment and we still have not recovered from the recession.

An intriguing discussion is definitely worth comment.
I think that you need to write more about this issue, it may not be a taboo matter but usually people don‚Äôt talk about these subjects.
To the next! Best wishes!!
