RNC: The War on Women & 5 Questions for Mitt Romney
September 4, 2012

The challenges of woman-owned businesses was the hot topic at the Woman Up panel hosted by YG.
By the last day of the Republican National Convention, the weather had calmed down tremendously, as the last remnants of Hurricane Issac left Tampa and were replaced with muggy, humid weather.
I attended  Woman Up, a political forum for conservative women to meet to discuss social, political and business networking. Hosted by YG, a non-profit 501(c)(4) dedicated to supporting conservative and center-right policies, the “Yes, It’s My Business!” panel discussed obstacles women-owned businesses face and what policies are needed to overcome them.
Healthcare and the “war on women” quickly became the focal point of the forum as business owners expressed their frustration over the recently enacted Affordable Healthcare Act. “I have a seasonal type [of] business [which I personally fund] and every dollar I invest and spend is important to me. If I spend it on healthcare needs for my employees—that’s a dollar that I won’t have to spend it on growing my business,” said panelist Carol Smith Donovan.
Regarding the “War on Women,” panelists agreed that they felt it was just a diversionary tactic aimed at dividing and defining women to capture votes.

“It’s not really looking at the facts or initiatives that Republicans have taken to include women,” said  Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA).
After the conclusion of Woman Up, I checked in for my final volunteer shift at the Tampa Bay Times Forum. Hundreds of delegates, dignitaries and guests milled around in giddy anticipation for Mitt Romney’s closing speech.
At the culmination of the convention, the energy was electric. Delegates stood on their feet in support of Romney as thousands of red, white and blue balloons floated down from the ceiling.  As I prepared to travel back to Washington, D.C, I left the convention with these five questions:

Education: The central theme surrounding education was “success” and “working hard” but that assumes that youth don’t work hard to obtain jobs. If elected, how would Romney’s economic policies differ from the Obama administration and what steps would you take to ensure more Americans obtain skilled jobs?
Immigration: While the GOP displayed an impressive list of minority speakers, I felt not one addressed the complexities of the immigration system.  What is Romney’s policy position on immigration reform?
Reproductive Rights: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie gave a powerful speech at  the RNC where he said: “Mitt Romney will tell us the hard truths we need to hear to end the debacle of putting the world’s greatest health care system in the hands of federal bureaucrats and putting those bureaucrats between an American citizen and her doctor [emphasis mine]”—If elected, what will Romney do to ensure that all women have access to critical reproductive services?
Medicare: How would vouchers help seniors keep their existing Medicare plans when the objective is to cut costs?  And, if we switch to a voucher system, how can seniors be assured that their needs are still being met?
Bipartisanship:  If elected, how will Romney effectively work through the current lack of bipartisanship in Congress?

This November, the election is your platform to deploy your voice. It’s time for a new generation of women to get politically engaged, and the YWCA is committed to continuing our legacy by standing with women and demanding that our voices be heard.
I pledge to get answers to my questions from both parties—and I encourage you to seek out your on answers prior to the November election.  In small towns and major cities across the United States, I urge you to ask tough questions! Attend local town halls, watch presidential debates—talk to Republicans, Democrats, Independents and Undecideds. Remember, when woman vote, women win!
I was proud to serve as a YWCA ambassador at the Republican National Convention and through my experience at the Republican National Convention, I can attest that the YWCA truly is the voice for every woman.
 
YWCA correspondents are attending the Republican National Convention in Tampa, Fla., August 27-30 and the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C., from September 3-6.

I spent four years trying EVERYTHING in Online Dating, and through a huge amount of trial and error, I produced a system that I will share for you. This book will take you, step by step, through everything you need to know to double, triple or even quadruple the number of women you meet online.

I travel all around the world for work, and it used to be really lonely. Now I can go onto Tinder and have a date lined up in a new city before I even get out of the airport!

I do not know if it’s just me or if everybody else experiencing problems with your blog.
It appears like some of the written text within your
content are running off the screen. Can someone else please comment and let me know if this is happening to them too?
This might be a issue with my internet browser because I’ve had this happen previously.
Kudos

Have you ever considered about including a little bit more
than just your articles? I mean, what you say is important and all.
However think of if you added some great photos or video
clips to give your posts more, “pop”! Your content is excellent but
with pics and video clips, this website could definitely be one of the
most beneficial in its field. Good blog!
