Need Help? Chat Now!
Chat online or text “PPNOW” to 774636 (PPINFO)* to get answers to your questions about pregnancy, birth control, emergency contraception, STDs, and abortion.
The Chat/Text program enables adolescents and young people to contact Planned Parenthood health educators through text or instant messaging to ask questions about birth control, emergency contraception, STD testing, pregnancy testing, or abortion. Planned Parenthood health educators answer any question related to these topics, and provide medically accurate responses using behavioral theory and communication science to encourage positive health behaviors.
Chat/Text health educators are trained to answer questions like the following, and more:

How do I know if I’m pregnant?
I forgot to take my birth control pill, what do I do?
What do I do if I forgot to use a condom?
How does the abortion pill work?
How do I treat a UTI?
How do I know if I have an STD?

Chat is available Monday-Thursday 9 AM-11:30 PM (ET), Friday 9 AM-10 PM (ET), Saturday 9 AM-5 PM (ET), and Sunday 12 PM-11:30 PM (ET).
