YWCA COVID-19 Emergency Relief and Community Resiliency Fund


							These are a few of many challenges our local YWCAs are facing.  In response to the outbreak, YWCA USA has launched the YWCA COVID-19 Emergency Relief and Community Resiliency Fund to provide emergency funds and in-kind support for COVID-19 preparedness, response, and recovery services, and to shore up critical housing, childcare, and domestic violence programs facing imminent risk of closure as a result of the pandemic.

Act Now




								Family Violence Prevention & Services Act (FVPSA)							



								Violence Against Women Act (VAWA)							








Strong bipartisan legislation was recently introduced in the Senate to reauthorize the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act (FVPSA) by Sen. Bob Casey (D-PA) and Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK). FVPSA provides critical funding for programs and services that survivors of family, domestic, and dating violence rely on.
Join YWCA in supporting this important bill by urging your Senators to co-sponsor FVPSA! 



									Take Action								




On April 4th, H.R. 1585, the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2019 (VAWA), passed through the House of Representatives. This critical and lifesaving legislation maintains the safety, resources, and protections that have been critical to all survivors, particularly women of color and other marginalized communities. The Senate STILL has not introduced a version of this reauthorization bill.
Urge your Senators to stand with survivors by supporting full funding of VAWA and passing a substantially similar bill in the Senate.
