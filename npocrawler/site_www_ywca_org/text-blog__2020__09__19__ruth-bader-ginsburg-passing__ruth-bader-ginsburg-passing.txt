YWCA USA Statement on the Passing of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg
September 19, 2020

Tags: Ginsburg, respect, U.S. Supreme Court 



Washington, D.C. –
On Friday, September 18, 2020, the Supreme Court of the United States announced the death of Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg after a years-long fight against cancer. Justice Ginsburg was 87.
Alejandra Y. Castillo, CEO, YWCA USA released the following statement:
“Our nation has lost a champion of equality. Justice Ginsburg was a pioneer, an icon, a fighter, and an advocate for the rights of all Americans. As an accomplished lawyer and Supreme Court justice, she broke through barriers of sex and religious discrimination even as she was barred from opportunities because of her caregiving role as a mother.
Justice Ginsburg’s lifelong work advanced justice with seminal decisions in the areas of sex discrimination, affirmative action, same-sex marriage, health care for all, the fight for equal pay, and the defense of women’s health rights. These decisions brought justice to all those whose lives were directly impacted and will continue to shape our nation for generations to come.
Ginsburg’s death, while heartbreaking to many Americans, also serves as a call-to-action 45 days ahead of the election. As we mourn her loss, we will honor her memory and her legacy by continuing the fight for gender equality and women’s rights. As Justice Ginsburg once said, “real change, enduring change, happens one step at a time.”
In the days before her death, Justice Ginsburg dictated a statement to her granddaughter, “My most fervent wish is that I will not be replaced until a new president is installed.” We should honor that wish as well as her fundamental belief that, “Women belong in all places where decisions are made.” I urge the Senate to focus on providing relief to nonprofits and to Americans who are still struggling because of the COVID-19 pandemic and allow the next President, whoever that may be, to fill this vacancy in January.”
Just like Justice Ginsburg did every day of her life, YWCAs across the country will continue to get up and do the work of justice, UNTIL JUSTICE JUST IS.
