Anti-Discrimination Training as a Response to Racism
April 27, 2012

Tags: anti-discrimination, diversity, George Zimmerman, intervention, Paulette Cross, race, racial justice, Salt Lake City, social justice, Stand Against Racism, training, trayvon martin, Utah, Week without Racism, ywca, YWCA Racial Justice Task Force, YWCA Salt Lake City 



by Paulette T. Cross, Ph.D.
Transitional Housing Economic Empowerment Specialist, YWCA Salt Lake City 
If someone or anyone had responded to the Trayvon Martin incident, perhaps he would still be alive today.¬† Response methods are critical in doing ‚Äúsocial justice‚Äù work.¬† When do you respond?¬† What do you say?¬† What if the intervention is wrong?¬† Or, what constitutes whether or not response or intervention is the right thing to do? To address these types of inquiries, one has to understand the notion of racism and its impact on society in the U.S..¬† Therefore, it is not only incumbent upon everyone to participate in social justice work, but also it is critical to understand the historical roles of race and racism in the U.S. Once this knowledge is rooted, it inevitably provides a foundation ‚Äì a way in which ordinary people can begin to participate in the social justice movement for equity and equality for all.
The Salt Lake City YWCA has embarked on providing anti-discrimination response trainings that begin to unravel the underlying myths that support racist and discriminatory attitudes.¬† More specifically, these trainings explain, direct and introduce us to responses that address discriminatory actions. The training is critical, because the notion of racism surfaces through unsuspecting scenarios that becomes identifiable among those who would argue that they are not racist; however, their actions betray them.¬† I would argue that George Zimmerman, before becoming Trayvon Martin‚Äôs alleged perpetrator, probably did not consider himself a racist or a detriment to society.
Finally, the Trayvon Martin case contradicts the myth that we live in a ‚Äúpost-racist society‚Äù in the U.S., and more importantly exemplifies and the age-old adage that ‚Äúracism is alive and well‚Äù. This translates to the question of how do we counter racism with anti-discriminatory actions?¬† The Salt Lake City YWCA‚Äôs Racial Justice Task Force has set its agenda on racial justice through events such as the YWCA‚Äôs national Stand Against Racism by presenting a Week Without Racism April 27 through May 4, 2012.¬† Throughout the week, a variety of events will be ongoing ‚Äî such as films, discussions, poetry and literature readings, and financial empowerment activities ‚Äî to begin conversations and promote understanding about racism, discrimination and oppression.¬† The project exercises consciousness-raising, not only among YWCA employees, but also becomes a campus-wide event as it includes residents, volunteers and their families.
Paulette T. Cross is the Transitional Housing Economic Empowerment Specialist for the Salt Lake City YWCA.¬† She has 20+ years of leadership roles in government, non-profits and academia.¬† Currently, she holds a leadership role in the Racial Justice Task Force in the Salt Lake City YWCA, and she facilitates trainings and advises residents on education, employment, housing and finances.

However, many individuals of those who never have yet experienced its power know what exactly
Reiki does and what its effects are. If you are considering the way

through the body, illnesses and diseases can appear. Reiki stimulates the flow of positive energy, thus enabling the body to heal itself and fight the internal and external attacks
better.
2. Cleans our bodies coming from all toxins.
Because it acts on the human body, it can be one of the
few complete detox programs one can possibly follow.
In addition to that this doesn‚Äôt involve
refraining from food or some other kind of activity. Yet, mental poison need to be banned from
your individual‚Äôs mind because they will have a negative impact
upon the treatment.
3. Promotes health, positive thoughts and relaxation. The principles of Reiki depend on positive
thinking, thus a comfort and relaxation is induced for the individual.
By removing negative energy and promoting a sense peace, the healing process
will likely be easier and shorter, regardless of illness or disease from which the person suffers.
4. Works for the digestive tract and improves the benefic effects of every little thing someone
ingests, from food and water to medicines and curative herbs.
Thus, it may be successfully used like a complementary therapy for the people already taking medicine, but as well it‚Äôs just the thing for maintain the average person‚Äôs health in good
parameters.
5. Works on personal feelings, helping people overcome negative experiences off their lives and managing unexpected or unpleasant situations from other lives.
People with depressions, anxieties or experiencing
stress are able to see dramatic improvements of these conditions following your Reiki sessions.
6. Makes the transition from life to death much simpler.
It helps the soul transcend into immortality and the body feel
less suffering from this transformation. This is why many Reiki adepts make use of the Ki to produce their
transition in one world to a new smoother.
Reiki offers healing for those varieties of bodily conditions,
as well as for the spiritual problems. It is like a best friend for those
those people short of funds, but it could also relieve healthy people from quotidian stress and problems.

A Parent‚Äôs Guide to Eczema.As a parent, you strive to give your child a happy and healthy life, but what if they suffer from eczema? The uncontrollable urge to itch and the unknown causes may be too much for you and your child to bear.As a parent, what are you to do?It is common to find rashes on children, but eczema is more than just a rash. It is skin condition that can turn into a struggle for both parents and children. You may have never heard of eczema until your child was diagnosed with it, but now what?Keep Your Child‚Äôs Skin Moisturized.There are different eczema trigger factors, which can lead to an outbreak.These trigger factors may include dust, stress, sweat, and laundry detergent.However, for some children, the cause is nothing more than dry skin. We instinctively want to touch and itch dry skin to provide relief and children do the same. Moisturize your child each day.Their itching may not completely cease, but you should notice an improvement.When moisturizing your child, aim for application throughout the day. However, the most important step is to moisturize their body immediately following a bath or shower. Your goal is to lock in the moisture.If your child is old enough, get them in the habit of reaching for moisturizer each time they feel the need to itch.Protect Your Child‚Äôs Skin.Eczema outbreaks are typically severe in small children.They don‚Äôt understand the complications that can arise from constant scratching; therefore, they continue to itch.If your child is old enough, have an eczema discussion with them. Encourage them to apply lotion or inform you whenever they feel the need to itch.However, for small children, such as toddlers and preschoolers, you need to protect your child‚Äôs skin yourself.As previously stated, the first line of protection is constant moisture. The second is to keep the area prone to outbreaks covered.This is especially important at night, as some children actually scratch their arms and legs in their sleep. When later asked, some are even unaware of their actions.The less direct contact the fingernails have with the skin, the less damage is done.Seek Medical Attention for Skin Infections.Most cases of eczema in children can be treated at home.However, children are at an increased risk for skin infections.Eczema creates the uncontrollable urge to itch. Your child may continue scratching until the skin is broken, leaving an open wound.Children will be children and that means coming into contact with many germs and bacteria.Combine these with an open wound and there is an increased risk for a skin infection.Treat your child‚Äôs eczema at home, but seek medical attention if you suspect the onset of infection.As a parent, you are unable to cure your child‚Äôs eczema, but you help protect them from the lifelong complications, such as scars.

Create Energy When Talking On Your Phone. More and more people are afraid that they will have to give up some of the household appliances they have so much longed for because the energy consumption is far above their financial possibilities.Thus, after months or even years of saving money in order to purchase what they want and like the most, many individuals see the need of getting rid of them because they no longer can afford paying huge electricity bills.Most of the times giving up those electrical appliances also means giving up comfort and turning back to a lifestyle characteristic to the past years, it means frustration and sorrow and sometimes even hours wasted by doing by hand something which an electrical appliance can do in a few minutes.If your electricity bill is sucking out your last pennies, then you probably know what I am talking about.However, this situation which for many people seems hopeless can be solved in a much easier and comfortable way.All you need in order to diminish your energy bill is another source of energy, a cheap and easy to use source that will provide you with enough energy to power small appliances and significantly lower the amount of power you use from the national or local electricity provider.This power source, which can represent your salvation, is the banal phone line.Each and every day, power runs through the phone cables, power which is mainly used for keeping the phone working and sustaining the conversation.During the day, this power is used, as people are talking on the phone, but during the late hours of the night the number of people using the phone line is relatively low, so that you can gather all that energy and use it to power your appliances.This energy is included in your phone bill, so there is something you pay for, thus you have all the right to use something for which you pay.To fully take advantage of this type of power you will need a device which will gather the energy from the phone and make it ready for use.The good thing about this device is that, even though it is more efficient during the night, it can also be used during the day or even when you are speaking on the phone.You will see that in a few months you will be able to use all your appliances and still save money on your electricity bill to fulfill some of your dreams.

Create Energy When Talking On Your Phone. More and more people are afraid that they will have to give up some of the household appliances they have so much longed for because the energy consumption is far above their financial possibilities.Thus, after months or even years of saving money in order to purchase what they want and like the most, many individuals see the need of getting rid of them because they no longer can afford paying huge electricity bills.Most of the times giving up those electrical appliances also means giving up comfort and turning back to a lifestyle characteristic to the past years, it means frustration and sorrow and sometimes even hours wasted by doing by hand something which an electrical appliance can do in a few minutes.If your electricity bill is sucking out your last pennies, then you probably know what I am talking about.However, this situation which for many people seems hopeless can be solved in a much easier and comfortable way.All you need in order to diminish your energy bill is another source of energy, a cheap and easy to use source that will provide you with enough energy to power small appliances and significantly lower the amount of power you use from the national or local electricity provider.This power source, which can represent your salvation, is the banal phone line.Each and every day, power runs through the phone cables, power which is mainly used for keeping the phone working and sustaining the conversation.During the day, this power is used, as people are talking on the phone, but during the late hours of the night the number of people using the phone line is relatively low, so that you can gather all that energy and use it to power your appliances.This energy is included in your phone bill, so there is something you pay for, thus you have all the right to use something for which you pay.To fully take advantage of this type of power you will need a device which will gather the energy from the phone and make it ready for use.The good thing about this device is that, even though it is more efficient during the night, it can also be used during the day or even when you are speaking on the phone.You will see that in a few months you will be able to use all your appliances and still save money on your electricity bill to fulfill some of your dreams.
