Using Technology to Prevent Violence and Promote Healthy Relationships

By Hillary Soens, MPA
Interim Executive Director, YWCA of Olympia
Hillary Soens, MPA
The YWCA of Olympia is an active member of the Thurston Coalition for Women’s Health. This community coalition includes 19 public and private organizations that work collaboratively to improve the health of local women and girls. The Coalition’s focus is on gender-related health disparities and their top priority is preventing violence against women and girls. In 2013, the Coalition launched a healthy relationships social media campaign for young people, ages 10-14.
The YWCA of Olympia worked closely with TOGETHER!, another local nonprofit, to produce videos as part of this social media campaign. During our 4-day Girls Without Limits! Spring Break Camp, YWCA participants ages 10-14 produced videos that described healthy relationships for their age group, showed warning signs of unhealthy relationships and provided resources for teens to get help if they need it. Girls engaged in a facilitated conversation about healthy relationships, met professional women working in the film industry in order to learn the technical skills needed to produce the videos themselves, and participated in a Social Marketing 101 workshop. TOGETHER! then edited the videos further in order to use them for the campaign and disseminate them county-wide.
The videos have reached hundreds of thousands of households via 75 showings on Thurston County Television, hundreds of views online, and through local presentations by Coalition members. The project was written up in Spouses Magazine, and posters advertising them were placed in businesses and schools around Thurston County, Washington. Take a look at the videos with the young people in your life.
Here are some tips about how you can talk with youth about healthy relationships:

Talking about healthy relationships is not “the sex talk,” but a broad conversation about behaviors, attitudes, expectations and more.


Respect is an important part of the conversation because it means different things to different families, so you want to make sure your child has their own strong definition.


Let your child know that you’re always available, and when they approach you make time for them.

Some resources our team recommends for parents:

Healthfinder.gov has a walk-through on how to talk to your teen about healthy relationships


“Break the Silence: Stop the Violence” is a CDC video made for parents about what teens are facing


LoveisRespect.org is a site built for youth but it’s great for parents too!

The YWCA of Olympia, TOGETHER!, and the Thurston Coalition for Women’s Health are proud to be part of the 2013 YWCA Week Without Violence ™.

When I originally commented I clicked the “Notify me when new comments are added” checkbox and now each time a comment is
added I get three emails with the same comment. Is there any way
you can remove people from that service? Thanks a lot!

Hey would you mind sharing which blog platform you’re using?
I’m going to start my own blog in the near future but I’m having
a tough time deciding between BlogEngine/Wordpress/B2evolution and Drupal.
The reason I ask is because your layout seems different then most blogs and I’m looking
for something unique.                  P.S My apologies for getting off-topic but I had to ask!

It’s very effortless to find out any topic on web as compared to books, as I found this article at this site.

Howdy! Do you know if they make any plugins to protect
against hackers? I’m kinda paranoid about losing everything
I’ve worked hard on. Any suggestions?
