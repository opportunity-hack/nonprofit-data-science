Conference Take-Aways: Advocating for Women on Capitol Hill Was Empowering

I had the opportunity to attend the YWCA USA National Conference in Washington DC.  It was my first trip to the Capitol and my first Capitol Hill Day.  The whole experience was amazing.  Since it was my first time, I went with an open mind to the new experience.  We met with staff members of the representatives from our two senators and one of our house representatives.  All three of Hawaii’s representatives’ staff members were friendly and supportive for the VAWA, CCDBG and CDBG.  The representative asked questions to gain information on what our programs offer and any issues that we are experiencing.  Many of the staff members had ties to Hawaii.  It was neat to see people from Hawaii helping to make a difference in Congress.
It was quite a site seeing all the Persimmon Women marching towards Capitol Hill.  The energy, inspiration and empowerment that were felt during the YWCA USA National Conference will be something I will not forget.  It has made me more appreciative of what I have and has given me the drive to help even more.  Even if it is one person at a time, I can make a difference.  Since I work with youth, I want to instill in them the concept that even helping one person can make a difference.

I was suggested this website by my cousin. I am not sure whether this post is written by
him as nobody else know such detailed about my problem.
You’re wonderful! Thanks!

I’ve learn some good stuff here. Certainly worth bookmarking for
revisiting. I wonder how so much effort you put to create the sort of excellent informative website.
