Because of business and community leaders like you, ONE Community and ONE Community Foundation have been able to lead the conversation on the importance of equality and inclusion in the state of Arizona - and our programs have become a model for building sustainable economies across the nation.
Our new UNITY Champion program for LGBTQ and allied community members will not only enable us to continue our important work, but will align you with like-minded Arizonans, expand your circles of influence through networking opportunities, and put a spotlight on your support of diversity, inclusion and equality for all Arizonans.
UNITY Champions are LGBTQ and allied businesses or organizations that invest in ONE Community and/or ONE Community Foundation for a total combined investment of $7,500 or above.

Your investment in UNITY Champions includes:

ONE Community Roundtable
Quarterly updates and the inside scoop and make sure that you have the opportunity to align with like-minded organizations that will help bring equality to Arizona.
