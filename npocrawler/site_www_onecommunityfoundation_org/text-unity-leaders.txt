Because of people like you…
Our UNITY Leader program for LGBTQ and allied community members will not only enable us to continue our important work, but will align you with like-minded Arizonans, expand your circles of influence through networking opportunities, and put a spotlight on your support of diversity, inclusion and equality for all Arizonans.
Your support is invaluable and integral to ensuring we live in an Arizona that celebrates, respects and protect all who live here no matter who they are or who they love. Thank you for standing with us.
UNITY Leaders are LGBTQ and allied community members that make a tax-deductible investment in ONE Community Foundation at a $100 a month or $1,000 annually or above.
