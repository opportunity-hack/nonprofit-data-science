Meet our new Development Director, Janine Skinner
Angela Hughey  /  Feb 01, 2018  8:31 AM






Please join us in giving a warm welcome to Janine Skinner. Janine is joining our team as ONE Community Foundation's Development Director.
After raising three children in Arizona - two of whom are LGBTQ - Janine became fiercely passionate about making her home state an inclusive and affirming place for all. She and her husband Dennis started volunteering for ONE Community two years ago, and fell in love with our mission to create an Arizona that is truly welcoming and open for business to everyone.
For the past 10 years Janine has worked for Feed My Starving Children and was integral in helping to bring the non-profit to Arizona and to grow their Mesa packing facility to the largest in the nation. She brings her years of fundraising and partnership building experience along with her passion for equality to the ONE Community team.
