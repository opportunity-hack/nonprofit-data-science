2020 GOLF EVENT SUCCESSFUL
THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT!
Dear Sponsors, Friends and Supporters — Our fundraising efforts had to change in 2020 given the pandemic environment, so we looked for other ways to support our women. We very much appreciated the sponsors of our first fall golf tournament. See a few pictures below! If you have any questions, please contact us at 480-788-0615 or email info@positivepathsaz.org.
