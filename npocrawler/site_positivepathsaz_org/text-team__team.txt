Positive Paths leadership consists of dedicated, forward-thinking trailblazers committed to advocating and providing services for women and their families to enhance the economic stability and security of the East Valley community. In 2014, Positive Paths became an independent non-profit organization with a vision to encourage others to invest in the futures of East Valley women in need, and to support women to be resilient and positive contributors to their communities.
