​
Monthly donors step into this relationship of mutual trust and support in a powerful, committed way - enabling the Maman Shujaa to address the most urgent needs of their projects month on month.
​
These needs typically include operating costs for the Maman Shujaa Centers, construction and school fees for our Girls' School, and program costs for our Keep Girls in School program.
​testimonials"The Joy of Donating to HWR"
  
In 2014 our daughter Hilary met Neema Namadamu, became involved with Hero Women Rising, 
and told us about this wonderful organization that is doing positive work to empower women 
and girls through computer education, health/hygiene training, and ecology/environmental 
activities. 
 
My husband and I began donating occasionally to HWR, and in 2015, we met Neema for the first
time. Our friendship with her has continued over the years.  We decided to make a monthly 
contribution knowing that this is the best way for an organization to have a budget and plan 
ahead.
 
​
One of the loveliest aspects of my knowing Neema and HWR is the web of connection that has grown with many other people.  One HWR project has spread to my friends in New York City, Los Angeles, Orange County, San Bernardino County and Ohio who now donate and in turn have spread the word about HWR to others. 
​
 
I like the saying that “women build webs.” Neema and HWR are certainly doing just that 
all over the world, and I am delighted and encouraged to be part of that web.
