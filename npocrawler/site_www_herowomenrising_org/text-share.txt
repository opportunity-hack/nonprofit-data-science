You can have a major impact on the lives of women and girls in the Congo by sharing, Tweeting, and spreading the word to your friends and family.  
With the overwhelming amount of content being produced daily, it is hard for caring people to hear about important causes they may want to be involved with.  And without a million dollar marketing budget it is difficult for these causes to find their way in front of them.  But with your help, we can make it happen.
​
By sharing our Social Media posts, blog posts, emails, or just telling people about our work in the Congo, you can help make an impact.  We are in this together and even a small donation or a simple share on Facebook has value.  Thank you for your help.
