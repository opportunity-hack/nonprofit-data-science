We surpassed our goal yesterday by more than 50% - our goal was $2,000 and we raised $3,406 with our Facebook campaign!But even more than that, we were just blown away by the level of energy around the campaign yesterday.  The money we raised together will go so far in supporting our sisters in Congo.   But you didn't just give us money.

You gave us love, and you shared your love with your networks too.  You shared our campaign, and you shared words of inspiration.  You showed us how you truly feel about Hero Women Rising, and I want you to know that we feel the same way about you. P.S. If you wanted to get in on the #GivingTuesday action but didn't have the chance, you can still give, here.﻿news•donations0 views0 commentsPost not marked as likedContact UsHero Women Rising is an IRS-designated
