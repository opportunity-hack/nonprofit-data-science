VisionHero Women Rising aims to improve the conditions in which women and adolescent girls live in South Kivu province, eastern D.R. Congo.  
 
To achieve this end, we use education and technology to amplify women’s voices; teach them to advocate for their rights and for the natural environment; build their economic capacity; and support the development of other community grassroots women’s organizations. We envision a peaceful and prosperous eastern Congo, where women have equal access to meaningful decision-making at all levels and are empowered to contribute to society according to their own inspiration.    Learn More​
