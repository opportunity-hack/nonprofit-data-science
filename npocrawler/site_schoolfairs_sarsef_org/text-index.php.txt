Virtual science fairs for Arizona schools
SARSEF is committed to enabling all Arizona schools to hold science and engineering fairs 
     even during the COVID-19 pandemic. As such, we are providing this free virtual platform for 
     any school interested in holding a virtual science and engineering fair at the school level. 
     School Fair Directors can register their schools, upload projects, and open the virtual exhibit 
     hall for caregivers, relatives, judges, and friends to celebrate Arizona’s kid scientists and engineers!
  

This is a platform to hold science fairs at the school level at no cost to you. It is not 
  affiliated with the Regional SARSEF Science and Engineering Fair.

About SARSEF
SARSEF was formed in 1955 in an effort to increase student interest in the field of science. The mission of 
        SARSEF is to teach Arizona’s Pre-K-12 grade students critical thinking and problem-solving skills as they 
        participate in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) through inquiry-based learning and research. 
        SARSEF accomplishes this mission through a variety of programming including SARSEF Research Fair Week, 
        educational outreach programs with an emphasis on underrepresented populations in the sciences, teacher 
        professional development, ACES Camp for Middle School girls, Racing the Sun, and Arizona STEM Adventure. 
        Over 795 professionals in the community volunteer for SARSEF each year, and 145 organizations support its programs financially.
